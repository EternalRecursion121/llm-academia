Hume on Reason and Induction:
Epistemology or Cognitive Science?
PETER MILLICAN
The fourth chapter of Don Garrett's book Cognition and Commitment in
Hume's Philosophy,1 entitled "Reason and Induction," contains a powerful
and provocative discussion of Hume's argument concerning induction,
in which Garrett first outlines the well-known traditional "skeptical" and
contemporary "nonskeptical" types of interpretation, before criticising both
types very effectively. He then ends by proposing his own rival
interpretation which sees Hume's argument as descriptive rather than
normative, and takes its aim as being to establish a fundamental thesis in
cognitive psychology concerning the causes of our inductive reasonings,
with no direct implications, either skeptical or non-skeptical, regarding their
epistemic basis. In Garrett's view, Hume's concern is to establish that our
practice of reasoning inductively, though itself involving the exercise of our
inferential faculty (i.e., "reason"), does not have a foundation in that
facultyÂ—in other words, that our inductive reasoning does not result from
our first having made a higher-level inference about the reliability of such
reasoning:
In arguing that inductive inferences are not "determin'd by reason,"
Hume is neither expressing an evaluation of the epistemic worth of
inductive inferences.... Nor is he denying that inductive inferences
are a species of reasoning. He is denying only that we come to
engage in this species of reasoning as a result of any piece of
reasoning about it. (CCHP 94)

If correct, this interpretation implies that we radically rethink what Garrett
describes as "one of the most famous arguments in the entire history of
philosophy," which Hume himself "clearly regards...as one of his most
important and most original contributions," and which is indeed commonly
regarded today as constituting "the essential core of Hume's philosophy"
(CCHP 76-77). So it is to Garrett's discussion on the interpretation of this
argument that I shall devote most attention here. I shall begin with an
outline of his objections to the familiar interpretations of it.
I.  Garrett's Objections to the Skeptical Interpretation
The traditional interpretation of Hume's argument concerning
induction sees it as a straightforwardly skeptical attack on the rationality of
inductive reasonings, aimed at proving that such reasonings are entirely de-
void of evidential value. In relatively recent years this interpretation has
been advanced and developed most prominently by Antony Flew (1961) and
David Stove (1973), both of whom see Hume's argument as founded on an
implicit assumption of deductivism, thus explaining Hume's own endorse-
ment of it whilst undermining its pretensions to persuade anyone who is not
already convinced of the illegitimacy of non-deductive inference. Against
this interpretation, Garrett presents three powerful objections. First, that
Hume's supposed extreme skeptical conclusion seems incompatible with his
own widespread use and endorsement of inductive reasoning. Secondly, that
even if this first objection can be blunted by appeal to Hume's involuntarist
and non-rationalist psychology (which implies that he, like everyone else,
will inevitably continue to reason and believe regardless of his philosophy)
nevertheless a skeptical reading is hard to square with the unconcerned
manner in which Hume continues to use and to recommend induction.
Thirdly, that Hume's argument is logically inadequate to yield the skeptical
conclusion traditionally ascribed to it: "there is no reason why Hume should
regard the famous argument as itself sufficient to establish that inductive
inferences lack evidentiary value" (CCHP 81-82). Garrett backs up this third
objection with an outline of the structure of the argument as it occurs in the
Treatise, an outline which (unlike Stove's well-known structure diagram) is
both plausible and faithful to the text.2
II.   Garrett's Objections to the Nonskeptical Interpretation
The contemporary nonskeptical interpretation of Hume's famous
argument, like the traditional skeptical interpretation, sees it as yielding a
negative epistemological result about the basis of induction in reason, but
crucially reinterprets this result by taking "reason" here to be understood by
Hume in only a narrow "rationalist" or deductivist sense which is not
Hume's own. On this interpretation, therefore, the argument does nothing
Hume Studies
Hume on Reason and Induction      143
to impugn the reasonableness of induction, but shows only the impotence
of a concept of reason that is itself Hume's primary target and which he
rejects, manifesting this rejection most clearly by thereafter proceeding to
use the term "reason" in a quite different, broader and non-rationalist sense
that unashamedly embraces both demonstrative and probable inference.
Garrett devotes a fair amount of space to discussing four different
versions of this interpretation, dealing in turn with the work of Beauchamp
and Rosenberg (1981), Arnold (1983), Broughton (1983), and Baier (1991).
However his objections to all of them are very similar, and again essentially
reduce to three main points. First, that it seems implausible, given Hume's
general Lockean understanding of the notion of reason (according to which
reason comprises both demonstrative and probable inference), to take him
to be using that notion in a special non-Lockean "rationalist" sense within
the famous argument, when he in no way signals such a departure from his
usual practice. Secondly, that Hume's various summaries of his own conclu-
sionÂ—when he states that "we have no reason" to draw inductive inferences
(T 139) and suchlikeÂ—seem to be far stronger than merely a denial that
induction meets narrow rationalistic standards. Thirdly, that if the
argument's intended conclusion were really so modest, then much of its
structure, and in particular Hume's careful proof that the "Uniformity
Principle" cannot be supported by probable reasoning, would be entirely,
and manifestly, redundant.
III. Garrett's Three Criteria of Adequacy
Whether by design or otherwise, Garrett's three points against each of
the skeptical and nonskeptical interpretations follow parallel themes. The
first objection in each case concerns Hume's consistency in his use of the
term "reason" and in his implicit or explicit normative judgements about
what is, and is not, reasonable. The second objection in each case concerns
the strength of Hume's conclusion and his perception of its impactÂ—the
words in which he expresses it and the extent to which it does, or does not,
unsettle him. Finally, the third objection concerns the force and structure of
the famous argumentÂ—whether it has the power to imply the conclusion
that Hume supposedly draws from it, and whether its various parts make
sense when seen in the context of an attempt to reach that conclusion. So
we can draw from Garrett's discussion three corresponding criteria of
adequacy for any interpretation of Hume's argument, which will shortly
enable us to examine his own position in an appropriate contrast to those
that he dismisses. First, however, we must see in a little more detail how he
spells out that position in his book.

IV. Garrett's Own Interpretation
Having dismissed, on what are genuinely strong grounds, both of the
hitherto dominant interpretations of Hume's argument, Garrett presents his
own interpretation relatively briefly, somewhat giving the impression that it
will succeed by default as long as it can evade the objections already raised
against the "skeptical" and "nonskeptical" alternatives. In contrast to both
of these, his approach is radically unconventional in seeing the argument as
concerned only with cognitive psychologyÂ—with what causes us to draw
inferences in the way that we doÂ—and not at all with the epistemic
credentials of those inferences. So he takes the word "reason" and its
cognates here to be referring not to any normative, evidential conception of
rationality (whether narrowly "rationalist" or otherwise), but simply to the
natural human faculty that is responsible for our actual reasoning behaviour:
the faculty that determines how we argue and make inferences. This natural
faculty of reason is therefore, by definition, the causal foundation of every
one of our probable inferences, and this might seem to be in direct conflict
with the oft-repeated conclusion of Hume's argument, that probable
inference is not founded on reason. This apparent conflict is, no doubt, why
previous interpreters have almost universally taken Hume's "reason" to be
primarily a normative notion distinct from that natural faculty, and why
many have as a consequence felt compelled to see Hume as at some point
either inconsistent or equivocal in his use of that term and its cognates.3 But
Garrett has noticed that this circle could conceivably be squared by
interpreting Hume's conclusion not as a claim about the immediate
causation of each of our probable inferences, but rather, as a higher-order
claim about what determines us to indulge in the general practice of probable
inference in the first place. As he puts the point:
Hume should be interpreted quite literally, as making a specific
claim, within cognitive psychology, about the relation between our
tendency to make inductive inferences and our inferential/
argumentative faculty: he is arguing that we do not adopt induction
on the basis of recognizing an argument for its reliability, for the
utterly sufficient reason that there is no argument ("reasoning" or
"process of the understanding") that could have this effect.
It must be emphasised that this does not mean that inductive
inferences are not themselves instances of argumentation or
reasoning.... His point is rather that...they are a class of "reasonings"
(inferences or arguments) that "reason" (the faculty of making
inferences or giving arguments) does not itself "determine" (cause)
us to make. (CCHP 91-92)
Hume Studies
Hume on Reason and Induction      145
Let us now examine how well this interpretation stands up to the three
criteria of adequacy that we have drawn from Garrett's own discussion.
V. First Criterion: Lockean and Humean "Reason"
Garrett claims that his own univocal interpretation of Hume's notion of
"reason" corresponds with Locke's notion, in encompassing both
demonstrative and probable inference (CCHP 85). However the matter is not
nearly so simple, because a proper comparison between Lockean and
Humean reason must take into account not only their presumed scope, but
also their supposed nature. In the chapter on "Reason" in the Essay,4 Locke
states repeatedly that he takes this faculty to be one whose operations
(notably inference) essentially involve mental perception, and this applies
both to demonstrative and probable inference:
Inference...consists in nothing but the Perception of the connexion
there is between the Ideas...; as Reason perceives the necessary, and
indubitable connexion of all the Ideas...one to another, in each step
of any Demonstration...so it likewise perceives the probable con-
nexion of all the Ideas...one to another, in every step of a Discourse,
to which it will think Assent due. (ECHU IV xvii 2).
It is not clear whether Locke views the direct perception of demonstrative
and probable connexions between ideas as itself an operation of reason, or
whether instead he sees reason as working with perceptions provided by a
separate faculty or faculties (presumably intuition in the case of
demonstrative connexions).5 But whatever the verdict on this taxonomic
issue, it is clear that Hume's account of probable reasoning is radically differ-
ent from Locke's, for if there is one uncontroversial truth about Hume's
account of induction, it is surely that according to him probable inference
depends crucially on instinctive custom and not at all on mental perception
of probable connexions. The upshot is that Hume must differ from Locke
eirÂ«er in denying that probable inference falls completely within the
province of reason, or else in denying that reason is a faculty whose opera-
tions essentially involve mental perception. Both denials are indeed to be
found in the Treatise, but significantly they occur in different places. The
first (which implies that probable inference, though indeed a form of
reasoning, is "not determined by" the faculty of reason) is emphasised
repeatedly immediately after the argument concerning induction itself (e.g.,
T 91, 92, 97). The second (which openly admits, as operations of the faculty
of reason, inferences that are founded on the vivacity of ideas through
association rather than on mental perception) occurs later, when as we shall
see Hume reassesses the relationship between "reason" and "the imagina-
tion" (e.g., T 103, 225, 265).
Volume XXIV, Number 1, April 1998
146     Peter Millican
All this substantially reduces the force of Garrett's first objection to
interpretations that see Hume's notion of reason as being reinterpreted
between the famous argument and most of the remainder of the Treatise.
For it is precisely that argument which forces Hume to move away from
the Lockean paradigm, providing a clear motive for some such reinter-
pretation even if (as Garrett stresses) none is explicitly announced or
highlighted in the Treatise. And there is significant, albeit controversial,
evidence that a reinterpretation of "reason" was indeed intended or at
least belatedly acknowledged by Hume, in a footnote occurring quite
soon after the famous argument (and inserted while the Treatise was
going through the press), in which he points out a closely related
equivocation in his notion of the imagination:
In general we may observe, that as our assent to all probable
reasonings is founded on the vivacity of ideas, it resembles many
of those whimsies and prejudices, which are rejected under the
opprobrious character of being the offspring of the imagination.
By this expression it appears that the word, imagination, is
commonly us'd in two different senses; and tho' nothing be
more contrary to true philosophy, than this inaccuracy, yet in
the following reasonings I have often been oblig'd to fall into it.
When I oppose the imagination to the memory, I mean the
faculty, by which we form our fainter ideas. When I oppose it to
reason, I mean the same faculty, excluding only our
demonstrative and probable reasonings. (T 117-118n)
My own view of what is going on here can perhaps best be summarised
diagrammatically:
Demonstration   Induction    Whimsies & Prejudices     Memory

Hume on Reason and Induction     147
For the Lockean, demonstration and induction fall unequivocally within the
domain of reason because they are founded on mental perception of
evidential connexions. The imagination is quite distinct, and closely allied
with the memory (if not necessarily encompassing it). Hume's argument
concerning induction undermines this picture by showing that induction is
founded not on mental perception but on the vivacity of ideas through
association; even further, his notorious argument on scepticism with regard
to demonstrative reason (T I iv 1) indicates that this, too, crucially depends
upon the idea-enlivening propensities of the imagination (so we reach the
"Strict Humean" position illustrated in the diagram). However, having thus
done away with the Lockean understanding of reason's essential nature and
its implied warrant based on mental perception, Hume is anxious to avoid
the consequence that probable reasoning is on all fours with the "whimsies
and prejudices" that are the imagination's more typical offspring, so he
continues to make use of a reinterpreted reason/imagination distinction by
drawing the line between them in the same place as Locke, albeit on a very
different basis (the "Loose Humean" position in the diagram). Now the
distinction has to be founded not on the absolute contrast between mental
perception and the operations of the imagination, but instead on a division
within the operations of the imagination, between on the one hand those
that are "established," "general" (T 267), "permanent," "irresistable," "uni-
versal," "solid" and "consistent" (T 225-226), and on the other hand those
that are relatively "irregular," "changeable," "weak" (T 225), "trivial" (T 267)
and "frivolous" (T 504n).
To sum up, therefore, the attribution to Hume of an ambiguity or
transformation in his notion of reason is by no means gratuitous or ad hoc,
but has considerable justification, both philosophical and textual. If the
point of his argument concerning induction is, as I have suggested, to deny
that probable inference can be warranted through mental perception in the
way that Locke had supposed; and if, as seems clear, Hume was nevertheless
anxious to preserve the honorific title of "reason" for probable inference
(e.g., to distinguish respectable inductive science from superstition); then it is
entirely to be expected that his notion of reason should be transformed as a
result of his famous argument. And so ironically the same point that Garrett
rightly urges against the contemporary nonskeptical interpretation of that
argumentÂ—namely, the importance of sensitivity to the dominant Lockean
paradigm within which Hume was writingÂ—is precisely what might lead us
to expect such an ambiguity or transformation in his writings. The non-
skeptical interpretation may indeed have gone seriously wrong in seeing the
notion of "reason" within the argument as being essentially deductivist (and
hence non-Lockean), but this view of the argument as a pivot for the
Humean reinterpretation of that notion is independently quite plausible.

VI. Second Criterion: Hume's Conclusion and its Impact
How radical is the conclusion of Hume's famous argument, and how far
should he, or we, be seriously unsettled by it? Garrett sees his interpretation
as steering an appropriate middle course between the two extreme answers
to these questions that have previously dominated the literature: on the one
hand, the skeptical reading that takes the argument to be denying induction
any evidential force whatever; and on the other, the nonskeptical reading
according to which induction is left entirely unaffected by an argument
whose target is not induction itself, but only a bogus rationalistic ideal of
reason that was wrongly supposed to provide its foundation. Against the
latter interpretation, Garrett quotes a well-known passage from T 139, but in
doing so he omits what I believe is a sting in its tail against his own position:
Let men be once fully perswaded of these two principles, That there
is nothing in any object, consider'd in itself, which can afford us a reason
for drawing a conclusion beyond it; and, That even after the observation
of the frequent or constant conjunction of objects, we have no reason to
draw any inference concerning any object beyond those of which we have
had experience; I say, let men be once fully convinc'd of these two
principles, and this will throw them so loose from all common
systems, that they will make no difficulty of receiving any, which
may appear the most extraordinary.
Garrett comments on Hume's second italicised clause:
Hume clearly offers [this] as a recapitulation of his conclusion about
induction. But the claim that we have...no reason for making
inductive inferences appears considerably stronger than...the claim
that they are [less than certain]. (CCHP 86)
I fully agree, but to my mind the claim that we have no reason for making
inductive inferences also appears considerably stronger than the mere denial
that we reason inductively because we have been moved to do so by a
higher-level argument concerning induction's reliability.6 Moreover Hume's
final clause (omitted by Garrett) makes very clear that this appearance is no
illusionÂ—for how could he imagine that the denial that we are led by an
argument to take up the practice of induction would be sufficient to "throw
[men] loose from all common systems," when it was anyway no part of the
established Lockean orthodoxy to suppose that our inductive practices were
founded on such an argument? Rather, Locke sees induction as founded on
the immediate perception of probable connexions, conditioned by what we
observe "in the ordinary course of Things" (ECHU IV iii 28), and as far as I
know he never presents any further argument aimed at proving that such
Hume Studies
Hume on Reason and Induction      149
perception, or the inductive inferences based on it, must be reliable, and
never claims that people are moved to take up induction through the
recognition of any such argument. The nearest he gets to doing so is when
accounting for our idea of power (ECHU II xxi 1), where he hints at an
argument which Hume was later to spell out but dismiss as a putative
justification of induction (T 90-91; EHU 36-38). But this argument makes no
appearance in Locke's discussion of reason itself, and an insistence that
induction should be based on such an argument seems somewhat contrary to
the spirit of his view of reason, which he saw as having a God-given "native
Faculty" to draw inferences without dependence on formal rules (ECHU IV
xvii 4), and operating accordingly, as we have seen, on the basis of directly
perceived demonstrative and probable connexions between ideas rather than
such higher-level reflections.
The passage from T 139 is not the only statement of Hume's conclusion
that seems too strong to square with Garrett's interpretation. For on this
interpretation it is only the general practice of induction that fails to be
determined by reason, and each of our particular inductive inferences is itself
an instance of the operation of our reason. But Hume's sceptical
pronouncements do not confine themselves in this way:
When the mind...passes from the idea or impression of one object
to the idea or belief of another, it is not determin'd by reason. (T 92;
see also the similar passage at T 97)
I say then, that, even after we have experience of the operations
of cause and effect, our conclusions from that experience are Â«or
founded on reasoning, or any process of the understanding. (EHU
32)
If "reason," or equivalently "the understanding,"7 is just the human faculty
that underlies our inferential behaviour, then it is hard to see why Hume
should deny that a specific inference, and the drawing of a particular conclu-
sion, are "determin'd by" or "founded on" that faculty. And if he is merely
denying that we are moved to practise induction by some process of higher-
order reasoning, then why when he uses this very word rather than the
faculty term "reason," does he pointedly broaden it to the all-inclusive
"reasoning, or any process of the understanding"? The following passage is
even more emphatic:
He...infers the existence of one object from the appearance of the
other...[but it is not] by any process of reasoning, he is engaged to
draw this inference.... And though he should be convinced that his
understanding has no part in the operation... (EHU 42)
Volume XXIV, Number 1, April 1998
150     Peter Millican
On Garrett's interpretation, our reason or understanding is precisely our
inferential faculty, and is therefore certainly responsible for our inductive
reasoning even if it is not the source of any higher-order reasoning that leads
us to practise it. So Hume must here be seen as sloppy to the point of explicit
self-contradiction, in saying that our inferential faculty "has no part" in the
drawing of a probable inference.
VII. Third Criterion: The Argument's Force and Structure
In the course of criticising the traditional skeptical interpretation,
Garrett provides an excellent summary of Hume's argument as it occurs in
the Treatise, adding the comment that "the structure and language of the
other versions of the argument are parallel" (CCHP 82). On the basis of this
summary he describes Hume's argumentative procedure as follows:
The general strategy is clear: to argue (i) that "determination of"
inductive inferences "by reason" requires that a certain proposition
(the Uniformity Thesis) be "founded" on some argument, an
argument that must be of one of two kindsÂ—demonstrative or
probable...Â—and then to argue (ii) that neither kind of argument
can do the job required. (CCHP 82)
He goes on to draw two contrasting moralsÂ—that on the one hand, stage (i)
is too narrowly focused (on types of argument) if Hume's aim were to show
that induction is devoid of evidential value (the most it could show is that
induction cannot be founded on argument, which of course fits Garrett's own
interpretation well); while on the other hand, stage (ii) seems too broad if
Hume's aim here were to show only that induction cannot be founded on
demonstration. So for the purposes of the skeptical interpretation Hume's
argument is too weak, and for those of the nonskeptical interpretation, it is
too strong.
I shall now try to show that on Garrett's own interpretation, Hume's
argument is in different respects both too weak and too strong. Too weak, in
that Hume focuses only on legitimate forms of argument which on Garrett's
principles he has no right to do; too strong, in that at least in the Enquiry,
Hume clearly addresses and dismisses the possibility that induction could be
based on non-inferential grounds.
To start with the second and less crucial part of my claim, it can I
believe be conclusively shown that the argument of the Enquiry is signi-
ficantly different in structure from that of the Treatise, and in more than one
respect. However, I shall not go into detail here, because I have written on
this extensively elsewhere (see endnote 2), and for present purposes it is
sufficient to draw attention to the passage in the Enquiry where Hume
explicitly   establishes   the   point   that   argumentÂ—a   chain   of  reasoning
Hume Studies
Hume on Reason and Induction     151
involving intermediate propositionsÂ—is necessary if induction is to be
appropriately founded:
Now this is a process of the mind or thought, of which I would
willingly know the foundation. It is allowed...that there is no
known connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret
powers; and consequently, that the mind is not led to form such a
conclusion concerning their constant and regular conjunction, by
anything which it knows of their nature. As to past Experience...why
this experience should be extended to future times, and to other
objects...this is the main question on which I would insist.... At
least, it must be acknowledged that there is here a consequence
drawn by the mind; that there is a certain step taken; a process of
thought, and an inference, which wants to be explained.... I shall al-
low, if you please, that the one proposition may justly be inferred
from the other.... But if you insist that the inference is made by a
chain of reasoning, I desire you to produce that reasoning. The con-
nexion between these propositions is not intuitive. There is required
a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an inference....
(EHU 33-34)
It is only after this that Hume goes on to itemise the various types of
argument, and to examine both demonstrative and probable reasoning in
turn. So on Garrett's interpretation this passage seems hard to account for:
why should Hume go to the trouble of explicitly denying that induction can
be founded on perception of objects' powers, or on intuition, if his only
concern is to rule out argument as its basis?
Although this objection is very similar in spirit to that which Garrett
correctly urges against the nonskeptical interpretation, it is admittedly less
decisive, because it concerns only the argument as it occurs in the Enquiry,
and indeed a passage within that argument in which Hume might fairly
plausibly be thought to be "beating about the neighbouring fields" (T 78)
rather than going straight to the heart of the matter.8 Besides, the additional
considerations that Hume adduces here, even if they are irrelevant to his
purpose on Garrett's interpretation, clearly do nothing to undermine his
argument. Far more serious, therefore, is my complementary claim, that
Hume's argument in both the Treatise and the Enquiry is far too weak to
establish the proposition which, according to Garrett, is his intended
conclusion.
Suppose Hume were indeed primarily concerned to show that we are not
moved to practise induction on the basis of a higher-order argument about
itÂ—what would be the appropriate way for him to proceed? Surely it would
be to focus on considerations such as the following. First, that infants, and
Volume XXIV, Number 1, April 1998
152     Peter Millican
animals, universally make use of inductive prediction even though they
are clearly in no position to understand, let alone to frame for themselves,
higher-order arguments about it. And secondly, that we often character-
istically draw inductive conclusions unreflectively and immediately, even in
cases where we have never before reflected on the relevant uniformity. Both
of these have to do with ratiocination, or more precisely, with its absence,
and both happen to be points that are indeed made by Hume, but im-
portantly only after the statement of his famous argument (the first at EHU
39 and in his discussions on the reason of animals; the second at T 103-104).
In both cases, he draws the moral that these points corroborate the conclu-
sion of that argument, but they clearly do not constitute essential, or even
significant, parts of it.
Now let us contrast all this with the considerations that Hume actually
does adduce in the development of his argument:
Â•  That causal connections cannot be known a priori, but can only be
discovered by experience.
Â•  That any inference from experience, if it is to be founded on reason,
must be based on the supposition of a resemblance between observed
and unobserved.
Â•  That this supposition cannot be known by intuition, nor established
through sensory knowledge of objects' powers, but must therefore be
founded on argument if it is to play the required role.
Â•  That any argument for this supposition can only be demonstrative or
probable.
Â•  That because its contrary is conceivable, it cannot be the subject of
demonstration.
Â•  That no probable argument for the supposition is possible either,
because any probable argument must take it for granted and would
therefore be "going in a circle" (EHU 36).
Now on Garrett's interpretation I just do not see how Hume has any right to
help himself to all these "cannots," "can onlys," and "musts." He was well
aware that previous philosophers had purported to know truths about
causation a priori and to demonstrate matters of fact,9 and his writings
include plenty of refutations of bogus arguments that fit neither of the
categories of demonstrative or probable inference as he characterises them
(indeed the notorious final paragraph of the first Enquiry is directed precisely
against such bogus arguments, and "Hume's Fork," as it has come to be
called, is entirely premised on their existence).10 So the only way to make
sense of what Hume says, in my opinion, is to see him as prescribing limits
not on what can be claimed, or inferred, or argued, but on what can
legitimately be claimed, or inferred, or argued. In other words he must be
Hume Studies
Hume on Reason and Induction      153
operating with a concept of reason which is epistemological and normative
rather than, as Garrett claims, purely psychological and descriptive. Otherwise
his argumentative strategy is gratuitous at best, and at worst incom-
prehensible.
As a particular example, let us take his claim that the Uniformity
Principle has to be founded on argument if it is to play the required role.
Why on earth should Hume feel able to claim this, if the "required role" is
simply to function as a premise in some process of ratiocinationÂ—
specifically, some piece of reasoning, good or bad, for the conclusion that
induction will be reliable? The Uniformity Principle could play this role even
if it were merely an arbitrary flight of fancy, or an assumption which we take
for granted because it has been implanted by God, by nature, by Descartes's
evil demon, or by we-know-not-what. The appropriate way to show that it
doesn't play this role, therefore, would be not to ask questions about its
epistemological credentials, or the arguments on which it itself might be
founded, but to focus purely on whether it features in the psychology of the
reasoning subjectÂ—the sort of thing that Hume considers at T 103-104 but
not within his famous argument.
Again, suppose the suggestion were to be made that we reason
inductively on the basis of something like the Lockean argument which
Hume canvasses at T 90 and EHU 36-37: we see that objects have behaved in
uniform ways, infer the existence of powers which make them do so, and
conclude that future objects will behave in the same ways because of these
powers. Hume himself responds to this suggestion (T 90-91; EHU 37-38) by
showing that the Lockean argument itself presupposes an inductive assump-
tionÂ—that similar objects will continue to be endowed with similar powers
Â—and he concludes that such an argument cannot provide a basis in reason
for induction. This response makes perfect sense if Hume's aim is to show
that the argument cannot justify inductive inference, but is largely beside the
point if instead he is aiming to show that the argument cannot motivate us
to perform inductive inference. For even if the Lockean argument indeed
takes for granted a particular inductive assumption, and hence can persuade
us only if we are already disposed to reason inductively in that respect, this
leaves quite open the possibility that such an argument might motivate us to
perform other inductive inferences. The fact that this inductive assumption
has no non-circular justification indeed makes it inappropriate as a solid
epistemological basis for any further inductive inference, but in no way
prevents its playing a role psychologically as a premise in such an inference.
In fact Hume acknowledges that a general principle of uniformity can
indeed be derived from experience (T 105, T 132, T 173), and can then play
the role of a premise in further inductive inference, for example when we
draw general conclusions from a single "experiment" (T 104-105, T 131). He
also states that most inductive inferences, where past experience is not

154     Peter Millican
completely uniform, involve the conscious weighing of "the experiments,
which we have on each side" (T 133). So as regards the psychology of
induction, no very substantial universal conclusion can be drawnÂ—some
inductive inferences are immediate unreflective operations of custom (T 104,
T 133); others involve significant ratiocination, including not only careful
consideration of past instances but sometimes even explicit application of a
principle of uniformity, with this principle itself being supported in turn by
reflection on past experience. However, Hume presents the conclusion of his
argument concerning induction as one that applies to all inductive
reasoning: "in all reasonings from experience, there is a step taken by the
mind which is not supported by any argument or process of the
understanding" (EHU 41). Not only does the language of "support" here
sound distinctly epistemological, but also, it is hard to seeÂ—in view of the
points just madeÂ—how this conclusion could instead be understood as any
psychological claim that Hume himself would wish to maintain.11
VIII. Conclusion: Garrett's Hume and the Hume of the Enquiry
Garrett has performed a major service to Hume scholarship in
developing his interpretation of Hume as a thoroughgoing empirical
cognitive psychologistÂ—every chapter in his book is interesting and
illuminating, and sheds new light on controversies both old and new. Nor is
this verdict shaken in the least by my suggestion that his interpretation is
fundamentally mistaken: even where Garrett (in my view) misunderstands
Hume's intentions, he does so because of a genuine unclarity or
inconsistency in Hume's writings, and thus highlights areas where further
research and discussion are needed.
The particular example of such an area on which I have focused here
centres on Hume's notion of "reason," which Garrett takes to be simply the
natural human "faculty of reasoning: of making inferences, or providing,
appreciating, and being moved by arguments" (CCHP 27). He accordingly
interprets Hume's famous argument about induction as concerned not with
epistemology (what warrant we may have for inductive inference), but with
psychology (what causes or motivates our inductive inferences). In developing
this position Garrett criticises, very effectively, the two hitherto dominant
readings of Hume's argument, which he calls the "traditional skeptical" and
the "contemporary nonskeptical" interpretations. Some of his criticisms of
the latter are, I believe, unanswerable,12 while his criticisms of the former at
least demand a careful reply from anyone who would continue to interpret
Hume as the inductive skeptic of traditional philosophical history. Such a
reply can, I believe, be made, but not without cost. In particular, it requires
that Hume's notion of "reason" be interpreted as ambiguous, with a
significantly different meaning within the famous argument from that
which it carries later in the Treatise and elsewhere.13

Hume on Reason and Induction     155
What I have tried to show here is that Garrett's interpretation too carries
a significant cost. Admittedly it has the merit of simplicity and elegance in
reading Hume's "reason" as univocal, but I have claimed that the price of
this is to render Hume's famous argument inappropriate and even
incoherent. If Hume's primary intention in that argument were, as Garrett
maintains, to establish only psychological truths about the causes of our
inferential behaviour, then HumeÂ—of all peopleÂ—could not consistently
set about this by means of a prioristic reasoning regarding the possible
arguments that might motivate us. It is a central pillar of his thought that
causal relations can be established only by observation and experience, and I
find it inconceivable that the author of Section VII of the Enquiry (much of
which has the explicit purpose of refuting any claim to a prioristic knowl-
edge of the mind's workings) would proceed to investigate an issue of
psychological causation in any other way.14
Garrett's interpretation also carries another related cost, that of making
Hume's thought far less relevant to us as philosophers today. For Garrett's
Hume seems to me to be guilty of precisely the sin which generations of
analytic philosophers have alleged, namely a "psychologism" which
damagingly confuses psychological with epistemological issues. There is, I
suspect, a fair amount of truth in this allegation, at least as regards the Hume
of the Treatise. But in my view the Hume of the Enquiry is a far more
coherent figure, who no longer uses terms such as "reason" and "evidence"
in the psychologistic way that Garrett emphasises,15 and whose principal
focus is now very clearly on epistemology and questions of rational warrant.
Again, the Hume of the Enquiry views argument in a far more modern way
than does Garrett's HumeÂ—thus Section IV of the Enquiry seems to operate
with a distinction between "demonstrative" and "probable" (or "moral")
arguments which, like the modern deductive/inductive distinction, depends
primarily on the logical relationship between premises and conclusion rather
than on the psychological "degree of evidence" which the argument confers,
or on the assurance we have regarding the epistemological status of the
argument's premises (cf. CCHP 27, 87, 94).16 All this adds up to a clear trend
in Hume's thought towards seeing his theory of reason and induction in
epistemological rather than psychological terms, a trend that we would
surely do well to follow.
To conclude, Garrett's interpretation of Hume's views on reason and
induction is interesting and suggestive, supported by solid scholarship and
by a powerful vision of what Hume is up to. However I believe that its
emphasis on Hume the cognitive psychologist undervalues the most central
contribution of Hume the philosopher, a contribution which Hume himself
was able to appreciate far more clearly by the time he came to write the
Enquiry, and whose presentation was modified accordingly. Garrett's Hume is
located squarely in the Treatise, where there are indeed strong currents of

psychology mixing in with the epistemology. Even in the Treatise, however,
Garrett's interpretation of Hume as a purely empirical cognitive psychologist
has great difficulty in making good sense of the famous argument
concerning induction, and certainly if we are to take our cue from Hume's
later example, we have compelling grounds for seeing the concept of reason
on which that argument hinges as primarily normative and epistemological
rather than psychological. Garrett is quite right (CCHP 95) to see Hume's
argument as a fundamental and seminal contribution to human learning,
and as a far stronger argument than most of Hume's previous interpreters
have supposed. But it earns this status as a fundamental contribution not, as
Garrett claims, in descriptive cognitive psychology, but rather in normative
epistemology.17

2    Though Garrett's structural analysis does not fit nearly so well the
argument presented in Section IV of the Enquiry concerning Human
Understanding, a point which I believe to be philosophically significant but
will not develop further here. For a detailed analysis and interpretation of the
argument as it appears in the Enquiry see my "Hume's Argument Concerning
Induction: Structure and Interpretation," in David Hume: Critical Assessments,
edited by Stanley Tweyman, six volumes (London: Routledge, 1995): II
91-144 (hereafter abbreviated "Millican").
3    Sometimes Hume clearly does use the term "reason" in a purely
descriptive and hence normatively neutral sense, for example when he talks
about "the reason of animals," or describes our reason as "fallacious" (EHU
55) and "weak" (T 182; EHU 72). But as we shall see, it is difficult to provide a
coherent interpretation of his arguments on the supposition that he is always
using the term in this neutral sense, and there are even some passages in the
Treatise where he seems very explicitly to adopt a normative posture, ruling
out reason as the source of some argument or belief on the ground that the
Hume Studies
Hume on Reason and Induction      157
latter fails to meet an appropriate standard of solidity, reasonableness or truth
(e.g., T 90-91, T 193, T 209). Hence it is perhaps not surprising that, as Garrett
says, "Few interpretive remarks about Hume meet with more widespread
agreement than the common claim that he uses the term 'reason' in several
different senses in his writings" (CCHP 94).
4    All references to Locke are to John Locke, An Esssay concerning Human
Understanding, edited by P. H. Nidditch (Oxford: Clarendon, 1975). Hereafter
abbreviated "ECHU" with page numbers inserted parenthetically in the text.
5    Locke is generally rather vague about assigning operations to faculties,
even in his chapter on reason itself. Compare for example "we may in Reason
consider these four Degrees...the third is the perceiving [ideas'] Connexion"
(ECHU IV xvii 3) with "In the Discovery of, and Assent to [intuitive] Truths,
there is no Use of the discursive Faculty, no need of Reasoning" (ECHU IV xvii
14). But this vagueness is perhaps less a symptom of carelessness than of
Locke's somewhat sceptical and even anti-realist attitude to faculties, as
expressed quite forcefully in ECHU II xxi 17-20.
6    For example it would seem odd to say that "I have no reason" for
believing that 1+1=2, that I exist, or that I am now imagining a yellow circle,
simply on the ground that there is no argument which would persuade me of
these immediately apprehended truths. And it would seem equally odd in
any scientific or philosophical discussion to say that "I have a reason" for
believing that extraterrestrials have landed just because my imagination is
captivated by some patently fallacious argument to that conclusion. "No
reason" in this sort of context typically means "no warrant" rather than "no
argument," and I see no reason to suppose that Hume means anything
different in T 139, despite Garrett's argument to the contrary! Garrett's
interpretation can claim more textual plausibility within the famous
argument itself in Treatise I iii 6, since Hume here seems to take for granted
that argument is the only possible source of warrant for induction,
understandably giving the impression that when he says "no reason" he
means "no argument." But as we shall see, even in the Treatise his discussion
makes sense only if we take him to mean "no good argument," and in the
Enquiry he significantly clarifies the normative thrust of his claims by
explicitly ruling out other kinds of warrant also.
7    Garrett has suggested to me in conversation that these faculty terms are
not in fact equivalent, and that Hume sees "reason" as just one part or aspect
of "the understanding," with intuition as another (the relationship between
"the understanding"' and "the imagination" is discussed particularly on
pages 28-29 of his book, but without any explicit statement of the
relationship between "the understanding" and "reason"). This suggestion
would not, of course, remove the difficulty of reconciling the above
quotations with Garrett's account, but I do not anyway agree with it, mainly
because there is clear evidence in Hume's writings of a tendency to use
"reason" and "the understanding" interchangeably, often apparently
alternating between them (as he does also between "the fancy" and "the
imagination") merely for the sake of elegant variation. Even in Book I of the
Treatise alone there are numerous examples of such apparent variation (e.g.,
T 88, T 92, T 150, T 180, T 186-187, T 193, T 211, T 218, T 268), and I would

158     Peter Millican
be very surprised if all of these can be interpreted consistently except on the
supposition that "reason" and "the understanding" are, for Hume, one and
the same.
8    Nevertheless it clearly does provide an answer to Garrett's corresponding
objection to the skeptical interpretation: stage (i) of Hume's argument in the
Enquiry does not focus only on types of argument after all, so it becomes far
more plausible to claim that his intention there is indeed to show that
induction is, in some sense, devoid of evidential value rather than merely not
founded on argument.
9    See for example the would-be demonstrations of the causal maxim
considered in T I iii 3, "Why a Cause is Always Necessary," of which Hume
says that "every demonstration, which has been produc'd for the necessity of
a cause, is fallacious and sophistical." Clearly he accepts that the human
faculty of reason is capable of producing "demonstrations" of propositions
whose falsehood is conceivableÂ—but he sees such "demonstrations" as
irrelevant to his claims about causation and induction because they are
fallacious. Dismissal of them on this ground is clearly inappropriate, however,
unless his notion of reason is nonnative rather than purely descriptive. For if
by "reason" he simply means our natural reasoning faculty, then he cannot
rule out a priori the possibility that reason might motivate us (as it
presumably has in fact motivated many people) through fallacious
arguments.
10    Note also that on Garrett's interpretation of Hume, he here overlooks a
whole class of perfectly good arguments which previous philosophers had
taken very seriously, namely deductive arguments which do not have "only
'self-evident a priori premises'" (CCHP 87). For the contrary claim, that Hume
did in fact countenance "demonstrative" arguments with non-a priori
premises, see Millican 96-98.
11    It will no doubt be true that in any inductive reasoning there is some
premise or inferential step which is psychologically taken for granted and not
itself inferred by further argument, and Hume might well agree, but this is an
unlikely candidate as his intended conclusion because it will obviously be
true of any (non-circular) human reasoning whatever, owing simply to the
impossibility of infinite chains of inference. Besides, Hume's claim is anyway
clearly intended to be more specific than this: given the logic of his argument
he surely means that in any inductive inference there is a particular step taken
by the mindÂ—namely the assumption of uniformityÂ—"which is not
supported by any argument or process of the understanding." This claim
seems plausible, and plausibly Humean, only if interpreted epistemologically
rather than psychologically.
12    For criticisms in a very similar spirit see Millican, 135-136.
13    In fact it arguably requires a three-way ambiguity, when the "neutral"
(see note 3), "Lockean" and "Loose Humean" (see section V above) senses are
all taken into account. Here the "neutral" sense is purely descriptive, while
the other two are normative, the "Lockean" sense applying within the
famous argument, whereupon it is displaced by the intermediate "Loose
Humean" sense for most of the remainder of the Treatise. For more on all of
Hume Studies

this, see Millican, 130-135.
14    Consider how Hume treats a parallel issue concerning the senses: "not to
lose time in examining, whether 'tis possible for our senses to deceive us ...let
us consider whether they really do so" (T 190). Abstract reasoning about what
might be possible can play at best a subordinate role in any Humean
empirical psychologyÂ—what really counts is what we observe to be actually
the case.
15    On page 228 Garrett states that "Hume does not use 'evidence' as a term
of epistemic evaluation at all. On the contrary, he consistently uses it to
mean 'evidentness'Â—that is, as equivalent to 'belief, 'assurance', or 'vivacity',
construed as properties of ideas." This is arguable as an interpretation of that
term in the Treatise, but it seems quite wrong in relation to the Enquiry, for
example Hume's uses of the term at EHU 26-27 and throughout Section X.
16    For defence of this claim, see Millican, 94-98.
17    This is not of course to say that Hume's philosophy of reason and
induction is purely normative, for it forms part of a largely empirical
investigation into the nature of the human understanding. The crucial point
is that it is not purely descriptive either.
