CHAPTER 20
Earman on Hume on Miracles
PETER MILLICAN
John Earman, in his book Hume’s Abject Failure: The Argument Against Mira-
cles (2000) and his chapter in this volume “Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles” 
subjects Hume’s essay on miracles (in Section 10 of the  Enquiry concerning 
Human Understanding ) to an abusive and merciless attack. According to Ear-
man, Hume’s argument is “a confection of rhetoric and schein Geld [Ger-
man for  false money ]” (Earman 2000, 73), and “a shambles from which little 
emerges intact” (see p. 269 above). More specifically, he alleges that it is “tame 
and derivative [and] something of a muddle,” presenting a hopelessly obscure 
thesis (see p. 260 above), based on a “proof” that amounts to little more than 
the dogmatic assumption that “uniform experience in favor of a lawlike gener-
alization leaves no room for doubt” (see p. 262 above). According to Earman, 
Hume’s only achievement in the essay is to disguise the crudity of his position 
through misleading “posturing and pompous solemnities” (see p. 262 above) 
which have seduced his readers into viewing his key “maxim,” in the final par-
agraph of Enquiry 10 Part 1, as an expression of “profound wisdom.” Instead, 
alleges Earman, this maxim is at best merely trivial and tautological, amount-
ing to “the correct but unhelpful principle that no testimony is sufficient to 
establish the credibility of a miracle unless the testimony makes the miracle 
more likely than not” (see p. 263 above). He goes on (in §5) to criticize what he 
calls Hume’s “diminution principle”—that the evidential force of testimony 
for any event diminishes in proportion to the unusualness of that event—and 
to propose (§6) that multiple witnesses can provide a clear counterexample to 
Hume’s apparent belief that a miracle could never be established by testimony. 
271272  Peter Millican
Earman then turns to the specific case of religious miracles (§7), arguing—here 
more against Mill and other Humean sympathisers than against Hume him-
self—that there is no reason in principle why testimony for a miracle should 
not support a religious doctrine. Earman is doubtful, however, whether such 
support could ever amount to an objective proof, though for reasons quite dif-
ferent from Hume’s (§8).
All this might seem quite damning for Hume, but let us see what can be 
pleaded on his behalf. I shall argue that his essay on miracles does indeed have 
some significant flaws, but it is far better than alleged by Earman, whose inter-
pretation of it can indeed be decisively refuted.
Hume’s “Proof” Against Miracles
Since he is so confidently abusive about Hume’s argument and the obscurity of 
its main thesis, it is especially disappointing that Earman himself is so careless 
in his exposition of it, for example talking quite inappropriately of “Hume’s 
‘proof’ against miracles” as though this referred to his overall philosophical 
argument. In fact, when Hume talks of a proof in Enquiry 10 he always means 
a strong inductive argument, extrapolating from uniform experience of a spe-
cific phenomenon, and providing full assurance  when taken alone . As he makes 
clear in a 1761 letter to Hugh Blair:
The proof against a miracle, as it is founded on invariable experience, is 
of that species or kind of proof, which is full and certain when taken alone, 
because it implies no doubt, as is the case with all probabilities.
(Hume 1932, 1.350)
Earman (see p. 261 above) suggests—perhaps with a hint of caution—that 
Hume “seems to be saying” that if L is a lawlike generalization backed by such 
a proof, then L should be assigned a probability of 1 (i.e. 100%), thus effec-
tively ruling out from the start any possibility of testimonial evidence counting 
significantly in favor of any violation of  L. In his earlier book, Earman was far 
more forthright in presenting this interpretation:
So here in a nutshell is Hume’s first argument against miracles. A . . . 
miracle is a violation of a presumptive law of nature. By Hume’s [princi-
ples], experience confers a probability of 1 on a presumptive law. Hence, 
the probability of a miracle is flatly zero. Very simple. And very crude.
(Earman 2000, 23)
On this interpretation, once “the proof against a miracle” has been established, 
there is no way that any further observation or testimony—however good it 
might be—could make any difference whatever to the miracle’s probability, Earman on Hume on Miracles   273
which even if multiplied by an enormous factor (due to that further evidence) 
must remain fixed at zero. But this is entirely contrary to much that Hume 
says, not least the final clause of the sentence quoted above from his 1761 letter 
to Blair: “. . . but there are degrees of this species, and when a weaker proof is 
opposed to a stronger, it is overcome.”
Earman (2000, 23, and see p. 261 above) omits this final clause, but it is cru-
cial to Hume’s position, providing the entire basis for the main scenario of his 
essay on miracles, in which there is “proof against proof” (E 10.11), with new 
testimonial evidence potentially overruling a previous proof from experience. 
So we have very strong grounds for rejecting the crude interpretation that Ear-
man initially proposes.1
Earman on Hume’s Maxim
Earman then moves on to another simplistic reading, but seems curiously 
unwilling to engage in careful consideration of Hume’s text, gliding above it by 
referring vaguely to other commentators’ views, while including not a single 
quotation from Hume himself:
Hume recognized that his “proof”2 only applies when the evidence 
consists of uniform experience . . . The real issue is joined when that 
proof is opposed by a counterproof from eyewitness testimony. Many 
commentators from Hume’s day to the present have read Hume as say-
ing that . . . uniform experience always trumps testimony . . . Let’s be 
charitable to Hume by not subscribing to [this] reading . . . The issue 
then becomes how to tell when the balance tips in favor of one or the 
other. Hume’s famous “maxim” might be thought to provide just such a 
prescription.
(see p. 262 above)
It seems odd to describe this treatment as “charitable,” when no evidence has 
been presented to suggest that Hume’s argument is anything like as crude as 
“many commentators” have thought. Moreover in other circumstances, Ear-
man himself is quite happy to dismiss the views even of “most commenta-
tors,” as we find when he gives his own—somewhat uncharitable—account of 
Hume’s maxim. Here is how Hume himself states it:
The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our atten-
tion), “That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the 
testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, 
than the fact, which it endeavours to establish . . .” 
(E 10.13)274  Peter Millican
And here are Earman’s comments on the quoted “maxim”:3
Most commentators have seen profound wisdom here. I see only trivial-
ity . . . the relevant probability of the event which the testimony endeavors 
to establish is P (M | t (M)& E), while the relevant probability of the false-
hood of the testimony is P (¬ M | t (M)& E). To say that the falsehood of 
the testimony is more miraculous than the event which it endeavors to 
establish is just to say that the latter probability is smaller than the former, 
i.e.
P(M | t(M) & E) > P (¬ M | t(M) & E) (1)
which is equivalent to
P (M |t(M) & E) > 0.5. (2)
On this reading, Hume’s maxim is the correct but unhelpful principle 
that no testimony is sufficient to establish the credibility of a miracle 
unless the testimony makes the miracle more likely than not.
(see p. 263 above)
Earman’s argument for this reading—both in this chapter and his earlier 
book—makes very little further reference to Hume’s text, but consists mainly 
of criticism of rival probabilistic interpretations, which are shown to fail in 
various ways.4 But all of the rivals that Earman considers share the same fault, 
of completely ignoring the significance, within Hume’s maxim, of the words 
“testimony . . .  of such a kind. ” They are all thus token interpretations of the 
maxim—focusing on the probability of individual items of testimony—rather 
than type interpretations, which take seriously Hume’s apparent concern with 
the typical probability of kinds of testimony.5
It is fairly easy to show that Earman’s interpretation is incorrect, by exam-
ining Hume’s argument leading up to his maxim, and the evidential weigh-
ing operation that generates it. Hume starts by pointing out that all evidence 
about the unobserved is derived from experience, with the weight of such evi-
dence determined by the consistency of the relevant experience. “A wise man, 
therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence” (E 10.4). He then emphasizes 
that this principle of inductive rationality applies not only to inference from 
personal observation but also to arguments from testimony, for “our assur-
ance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our 
observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity 
of facts to the reports of witnesses” (E 10.5). That being so, it is important to 
recognize that not all kinds of testimony are found to be equally reliable:Earman on Hume on Miracles   275
And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is 
founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, . . . according 
as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of 
object has been found to be constant or variable . . . Where . . . experience 
is not entirely uniform on any side, it is attended with an unavoidable 
contrariety in our judgments . . . 
 This contrariety of evidence . . . may be derived from several different 
causes; from the opposition of contrary testimony; from the character or 
number of the witnesses; from the manner of their delivering their testi-
mony; or from the union of all these circumstances. . . . There are many 
other particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the 
force of any argument, derived from human testimony.
 Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours 
to establish, partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that 
case, the evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, 
greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more less unusual.
(E 10.6–8).
In this last sentence, the unusualness of the reported event is identified—
alongside contrary testimony and the character, number, and manner of the 
witnesses—as one additional factor that bears on the credibility of testimonial 
reports. But Hume then immediately isolates this particular factor, and views 
it as balanced on the other side of the scale against the characteristics of the tes-
timony that incline us to believe it, resulting in “a counterpoize, and mutual 
destruction of belief and authority” (E 10.8).
After a couple of short paragraphs illustrating such “destruction of belief” 
(through the famous examples of Cato and the Indian prince), Hume quickly 
goes on to present the most extreme possible case of “counterpoize,” where 
the reported fact;
instead of being only marvellous, is really miraculous; and . . .  the tes-
timony, considered apart and in itself , amounts to an entire proof; in 
that case, there is proof against proof, of which the strongest must pre-
vail, but still with a diminution of its force, in proportion to that of its 
antagonist.
(E 10.11, my emphasis)
Two very important points should be noted here. First, Hume’s argument 
so far has treated a miracle as just an extreme case of an extraordinary (i.e. 
inductively improbable) event, and the general principles involved in this 
treatment are no different from those that he applies to any other extraor-
dinary event.6 Second, in sketching out how the counterpoise takes place, 
Hume has understood the strength of the testimony—“considered apart 276  Peter Millican
and in itself”—as yielding a single overall measure of proof which can then 
appropriately be weighed against the strength of the counter-proof that 
arises from the miraculousness (i.e. the extreme lack of conformity to our 
uniform experience) of the alleged event. The stronger of these two proofs 
“must prevail, but still with a diminution of its force, in proportion to that of 
its antagonist.” So the confidence we place in the testimony (or—depending 
on which is weightier—in the inductive evidence against the supposed event) 
will depend on the extent to which the testimonial proof (or alternatively the 
proof from experience) over-balances its antagonist. We have “proof against 
proof,”  with the overall credibility given not by either “proof” individually, but 
by the result of weighing them against each other . Neither side of the contest 
alone yields the appropriate credibility measure: that comes only from the 
comparison between them.
This point, which is absolutely clear from Hume’s text, refutes Earman’s 
interpretation outright. For on his account, Hume’s intended criterion of 
credibility is:
P(M | t(M) & E) > P (¬M | t(M) & E) (1)
On this criterion, both sides of the inequality represent an overall probability 
measure, on the left-hand side the probability of the miracle (conditional on 
the testimony and our past experience), and on the right-hand side the prob-
ability of no such miracle (conditional on the testimony and our past experi-
ence). Hume’s own maxim is nothing like this. On the contrary, as we have 
seen clearly from his text, his maxim involves a comparison between two quite 
different “proofs,” one concerning the relevant kind of testimony “considered 
apart and in itself” (in terms of the character, number, and manner of the wit-
nesses etc., but not the specific event reported), and the other concerning the 
event reported (in terms of its lack of conformity to our experience). We have 
yet to see whether this maxim can be given a suitable probabilistic representa-
tion, let alone one that is philosophically defensible. But what is quite clear is 
that Earman’s interpretation of Hume’s maxim is seriously mistaken.
A “Type” Interpretation of Hume’s Maxim
If the preceding discussion is correct, then Hume’s maxim must be under-
stood in such a way that the probability of the testimony “considered apart 
and in itself” is distinguished from, and weighed against, the improbability 
of the reported event considered independently of that testimony.7 Hume’s 
idea seems to be that different “kinds” of testimony (specified in terms of the 
character and number of the witnesses, the manner of delivery etc.) carry a 
different typical probability of truth and falsehood  independently of the event 
reported .8 Let us call this his  Independence Assumption . Suppose, then, that we Earman on Hume on Miracles   277
focus on a particular kind of testimony—whose characteristic probability of 
falsehood is  f—which either asserts, or denies, the occurrence of a particular 
type of event  M—whose probability of occurrence is  m. If the reliability of that 
kind of testimony is probabilistically independent of what is being reported, 
then we can apparently calculate the probability of a “true positive” and a 
“false positive” report as follows (as before using “ t(M)” to mean that M is 
testified to have occurred):
True positive ( M occurs, and is truly reported)
P(M&t(M)) = P(M) × P(true report ) = m.(1 – f)
False positive ( M does not occur, but is falsely reported as having 
occurred)
P(¬ M & t(M)) = P (¬ M) × P(false report ) = (1 –  m). f
If positive testimony has been given, therefore, this testimony will be probably 
true only if a “false positive” is less likely than a “true positive,” and hence in 
accordance with the formula:
P(M/t(M)) > 0.5 → (1 – m). f < m (1 – f)
which simplifies to:
P(M/t(M)) > 0.5 → f < m 
This result neatly corresponds to Hume’s maxim, since its right-hand side is 
exactly equivalent to saying that the falsehood of the testimony, considered apart 
and in itself is more miraculous (i.e. less probable) than  the event reported, con-
sidered independently of the testimony . Hume’s own route to this result was not, 
of course, so mathematical: he seems to have viewed the situation as involving 
a relatively simple trial of strength between the inductive evidence for the tes-
timony and the inductive evidence for the relevant “law of nature.” But given 
his apparent Independence Assumption, this yields exactly the formal result 
calculated above, which can thus stand as a faithful mathematical elucidation 
of his position, rather than an anachronistic distortion.9
The Non-Triviality of Hume’s Maxim
If Hume’s Independence Assumption applies to testimony for miracles in this 
way (for doubts, see the next section), then his maxim can indeed be of real 
practical value. To illustrate with a non-miraculous example, suppose that 278  Peter Millican
Fred wants to know whether he suffers from some genetic condition G which 
afflicts one person in a million. He has no other evidence either way, but a test 
is available which seems very reliable, in that whoever is tested, and  whether 
they actually have the condition or not , the chance that the test will give a correct 
diagnosis is 99·9%, and an incorrect diagnosis only 0·1% (so Hume’s Inde-
pendence Assumption plausibly applies: the test can be assigned a consistent 
probability of delivering truth rather than falsehood, independently of what 
the facts happen to be). When Fred later leaves the clinic in distress at having 
tested positive for  G, how convinced should he be that he does indeed have 
that condition?
Most people would, in my experience, judge Fred’s likelihood of having G 
in this situation to be very high, but in fact the reverse is the case, as Hume 
would recognize. As Fred stumbles out despondently through the clinic door, 
Hume might greet him with a consoling comment something like this: Con-
sider whether it be more probable, that this kind of test should be mistaken, or 
that you should really have condition G(cf. E 10.13).10
Given that the test is wrong one time in a thousand, while G afflicts only 
one person in a million, there is clearly a far greater likelihood of a mistaken 
test than of Fred’s actually suffering from  G. And so a positive test report does 
relatively little to indicate that he actually has the disease: in fact, it changes the 
probability from a negligible one in a million to the only slightly more worry-
ing 1 in 1,002.11 Hume’s maxim, therefore, is entirely correct in this case, and it 
also gives the correct answer for other relevantly similar cases. If, for example, 
we increase the “initial probability” of the disease to over one in a thousand, 
then the test indeed becomes credible. And this last point demonstrates a kernel 
of truth in what Earman calls Hume’s “diminution principle”: whether some 
alleged fact can be rendered rationally credible by some testimony depends on 
its prior probability (or in Hume’s terms how “miraculous” or “unusual” the 
alleged fact is) as well as on the characteristics of the testimony.
We have already seen enough to counter Earman’s insultingly dismiss-
ive view of Hume’s treatment of miracles. Certainly there are problems, as 
will become apparent shortly, but Hume deserves credit for enunciating a 
principle which clearly anticipates—by two and a half centuries—the iden-
tification of the base rate fallacy by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel 
Kahneman.12 This is a very common error in human thinking, whereby we 
naturally find it all too easy to ignore the background “base rate” of some 
phenomenon when assessing the significance of evidence for it. So on receiv-
ing a disappointing test report for condition  G, most people would be far 
more struck by the specific immediacy of that result—and the test’s apparent 
reliability of 99.9%—than by the memory of the general probability for G of 
one in a million. They would thus be seriously mistaken, and Hume’s maxim 
is potentially of considerable value as a vivid reminder of the need to take 
base rates into account.Earman on Hume on Miracles   279
Difficulties for Hume’s Position
Let us now take a more critical look at Hume’s implicit Independence Assump-
tion: that it is in general possible to consider a kind of testimony as conferring 
a typical evidential probability, independently of what it reports. Admittedly 
this assumption was not confined to Hume, and some of his opponents—
notably Richard Price (1768, §2, pp. 413–6)—themselves took it for granted 
when arguing in favor of miracle stories. Earman (§5) discusses Price on just 
this theme:
Price responded that “improbabilities as such do not lessen the capacity 
of testimony to report the truth” (Price 1768, 413). This is surely right, as 
was Price’s further claim that the diminution effect operates through the 
factors of the intent to deceive and the danger of being deceived, either by 
others or by oneself. Unfortunately Price overstepped himself in claim-
ing that when the first factor is absent, testimony “communicates its own 
probability” to the event.
(Price 1768, 414)
Hume’s argument, however—somewhat paradoxically—itself undermines the 
Independence Assumption from which it apparently starts, since the upshot 
of the argument is precisely to show that the same kind of testimony can yield 
very different probabilities, depending on the prior probability of what it 
reports. In the diagnostic example of the section above, a positive test report 
yields a probability for G of 1 in 1,002; but a negative test report yields virtual 
certainty for ¬ G (with the probability of G now close to one in a billion).13 
Moreover there is no good reason for expecting such a diagnostic test to have 
the same probability of error in both directions: for example an over-sensitive 
test for G might have a relatively high chance of erroneously identifying G (a 
false positive), while having very little chance of failing to detect its presence (a 
false negative). Likewise, there is no reason why someone, gazing over a foggy 
Scottish loch at twilight, should mistake a floating log for a sea monster with 
exactly the same probability as he would mistake a sea monster for a floating 
log. Indeed Hume himself is clearly aware that such mistakes are likely to be 
biased in one direction rather than the other, given “the strong propensity 
of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous” (E 10.19). So his own 
attachment to the Independence Assumption seems to be at most lukewarm, 
and his argument in “Of Miracles” is perhaps best understood as starting from 
the assumption but then discarding it, on the basis of both his maxim and also 
the psychological considerations presented in his Part 2. Price, by contrast, 
holds firm to the assumption, and hence has an untenable position.
Price nevertheless raises a serious problem for Hume’s position through his 
examples such as the lottery discussed by Earman (§5). The same problem—280  Peter Millican
identified previously by Joseph Butler (1736, II ii 3 [§11]) and George Camp-
bell (1762, I §1, p. 31)—also arises in the case of everyday reports, which we 
very reasonably believe even when the prior probability of the fact reported is 
far less than the prior probability of a false report. Imagine listening to a BBC 
radio announcement on 8th April 1967:
Foinavon, a 100-to-1 outsider ridden by John Buckingham, won the 1967 
Grand National after a dramatic pile-up stopped all the leading horses at 
the 23rd fence.
What is the prior probability that the radio announcer would get something 
wrong here? To be very ungenerous to the BBC, let us suppose that it is 5% 
(so 1 in 20 such announcements will involve a mistake). This is clearly vastly 
greater than the prior probability that a 100-to-1 horse with that particular 
(previously unfamiliar) name, ridden by a jockey with another particular 
(unfamiliar) name, should win after such a specific and unlikely calamity at 
that particular fence. So the testimony is not even close to being “of such a kind, 
that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeav-
ours to establish”;14 and yet we quite properly believe it. Hence Hume’s maxim 
is mistaken.
The fundamental flaw in Hume’s reasoning, as I have interpreted it, derives 
from the faulty calculation of a “false positive” report:
False positive ( M does not occur, but is falsely reported as having 
occurred)
P(¬M & t(M)) = P(¬M) × P(false report ) = (1 – m). f
Imagine if the 1967 Grand National had been an unremarkable race won 
by one of the favorites, but reported falsely on the radio. How likely is it, in 
those circumstances, that the report would be false  in precisely the way quoted 
above— naming Foinavon (wrongly) as the winner, alleging (falsely) a dra-
matic pile-up, and so forth? Clearly it is vanishingly unlikely; indeed it is so 
unlikely that the probability of such a “false positive” is far less than the prob-
ability of Foinavon actually winning as described. So any listener to the report 
is quite right to believe it, albeit with some slight reservation in proportion to 
the general fallibility of BBC reports. And Hume’s maxim is indeed refuted, 
as likewise in Price’s lottery example, where again the crucial point is that the 
probability of ticket number 79’s being falsely reported as winning is even less 
than the prior probability of its actually winning.15
So Hume’s maxim fails, except in a limited range of (typically artificial) 
cases such as the diagnostic test, where it serves as a useful warning against the 
“base rate fallacy.” However, I believe that much more can be salvaged from Earman on Hume on Miracles   281
Hume’s position by dropping his Independence Assumption and taking his 
arguments as pointing instead towards a revised maxim which encapsulates 
the point just made:
No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle  M, unless the testimony is 
of such a kind, that the occurrence of an M report of that kind ( given that 
M does not in fact occur ) would be even less probable than M itself.
Such an approach would shift the emphasis from Part 1 of Hume’s essay 
towards Part 2, from abstract probability to the psychological factors that 
falsely generate miracle reports. But further discussion of all this must wait for 
another occasion.16
Multiple Witnesses and Religious Miracles
Since Hume does not attempt to rule out the possibility of testimony suffi-
cient to establish a miracle,17 and he never denies that a genuinely established 
miracle could provide evidence for a religion, Earman’s discussions in his 
sections six and seven do not refute any position that Hume is committing 
to holding. From a Humean point of view, however, Earman’s treatment 
of independent multiple witnesses seems surprisingly complacent, especially 
his suggestion that “there seems to be no in-principle difficulty in arrang-
ing the circumstances so as to secure the independence condition” (see 
p. 266 above). Note that his results here crucially depend on the assump-
tion that the multiple witnesses are indeed  independent , so that the prob-
ability of some witness w2 reporting that M occurs is completely unaffected 
by what another witness w1 reports: they must not be colluding, or subject 
to any other common influence except for their perception of M itself (or 
its absence). But Hume’s own main concern is  epistemological , so it is not 
enough that the multiple witnesses be actually  independent (as assumed in 
Earman’s calculations); they must also be known to be independent. And 
in any situation involving miracle stories propagated by the adherents of a 
particular religion, it is almost inevitably going to be more reasonable—our 
experience of human nature being what it is—to suspect that the witnesses 
are not independent (through either collusion or delusive influences, exter-
nal or psychological), rather than to believe that some astonishing event 
favoring their religion has actually happened. That, at any rate, will be the 
natural Humean suspicion, and Earman has done nothing to refute it.18 So 
again, although he makes some interesting points on the Bayesian treatment 
of miracles, his discussion sheds relatively little light on Hume’s philosophy, 
which is far richer and more defensible than such a narrowly mathematical 
treatment can reveal.282  Peter Millican
Notes
 1. There is no space here for further interpretative discussion of Hume’s understanding of 
probabilities and proofs, which can be found in Millican (2011, §2, §6) and Fogelin (2003, 
43–53).
 2. Note here the point I make in the first paragraph of the firstsection above.
 3. In what follows, M is some potential event (typically a would-be miracle), t(M) is the 
occurrence of testimony for that event, and E is the background evidence (typically the 
observation of uniformities in accordance with the law of nature of which M would be a 
violation).
 4. Earman’s only substantial further quotation of Hume in this discussion is his (correct) point 
that the final sentence of E 10.13 treats the maxim as providing a sufficient  as well as necessary  
condition for credibility. The previous two sentences of E 10.13 also suggest this, and the 
three sentences together strongly corroborate Earman’s presumption (which he explains in 
a part of section 4 omitted from the chapter in this collection) that “sufficient to establish a 
miracle,” for Hume, means to render the miracle more likely than not , rather than to render 
the miracle certain .
 5. To illustrate the type/token distinction, consider how many letters the word “error” con-
tains. Two different answers are possible, because the word contains five token  letters (“e,” 
then “r,” “r,” “o,” “r”), but only three letter types  (“e,” “r,” “o”). The related distinction 
between kinds and individual items of testimony is applied to Hume’s maxim in Millican 
(1993), which independently proposes essentially the same formula that Earman favors as 
a relatively  plausible token  interpretation (Millican 1993, 490). But Earman also expresses 
serious reservations about it, indicating the likely superiority of a type interpretation (Mil-
lican 1993, 490, 491, 495 n. 8), though without attempting to work out the latter. Earman’s 
book references the paper (Earman 2000, 93), but unfortunately he ignores the reservations 
expressed there about his favored formula.
 6. In a note to the paragraph which mentions the Indian prince’s incredulity about ice (E 10.10), 
Hume sketches a distinction between extraordinary  and miraculous  events, but this plays no 
significant role in his argument. Unlike Earman (see pp. 262–263 above), therefore, I do not 
see Hume’s relative lack of engagement with these sorts of examples and complications as 
particularly relevant to the assessment of his position.
 7. Note that this distinction cannot easily be drawn within a token  interpretation of Hume’s 
maxim, which can only consider “the probability of the testimony” to refer to the probability 
of the particular item of testimony  (in favor of some specific reported event), which is there-
fore hard to distinguish—given that the testimony has been presented—from  the resulting 
probability of the reported event itself . Hence it is not surprising that Earman’s attempts to 
identify a coherent token interpretation lead quickly to triviality.
 8. In his maxim, Hume talks of the falsehood of a kind  of testimony as being “more miracu-
lous” than the event reported, and in the following sentences, he clearly understands miracu-
lousness as the inverse of probability. So he indeed seems committed to viewing kinds  of 
testimony as having a typical probability.
 9. Nor is there anything un-Humean about attempting to make these things mathematically 
precise. Hume himself did not have our modern probability theory to hand, but at E 10.4 
he explicitly recommends calculation in cases of opposing probabilities, “to know the exact 
force of the superior evidence.”
 10. Note that this is quite different from asking: “Which is more probable, in the light of this 
result: that this specific test is mistaken in saying that you have condition G, or that you 
really have condition G?” which would be trivially equivalent to asking whether the test result 
makes it more probable than not that Fred has the condition. Earman reads Hume’s maxim 
as expressing just this useless equivalence.
 11. Consider a population of a billion, of whom one thousand have the disease while 999,999,000 
do not. If all were tested, we would expect 999 true positives against 999,999 false positives.
 12. Their best-known article is Tversky and Kahneman (1974), with a striking example of the Earman on Hume on Miracles   283
base rate fallacy at pp. 1124–1125, under the heading “ Insensitivity to prior probability of 
outcomes. ”
 13. Testing a billion people, we could expect just one false negative result, and 998,999,001 true 
negatives. We might notice here that the test, in either case, impacts on the initial probability 
of G by a factor of approximately 1,000, which corresponds to the 1 in 1,000 probability of a 
mistaken test occurring. This might seem to revive the idea that the test can be seen as having 
a consistent force, and perhaps Hume himself was thinking along these lines, because the 
same sort of pattern will indeed hold for any similar case in which the relevant initial prob-
ability is very small (as with miracles). But unfortunately it breaks down as soon as we move 
to examples which involve more than two possible outcomes, as in the racing report and 
lottery cases discussed in the main text.
 14 Recall that “more miraculous” here is simply to be understood as “less probable,” and that 
Hume’s argument purports to be based on general considerations of probability (n. 8 above). 
So he would be begging the question against miracles if he attempted to erect some special 
hurdle against them without providing an argument to justify such discrimination.
 15. The difference in Earman’s urn example (see pp. 264–265 above) is that the prior probability 
of reporting a black ball as a white one is taken to be constant, irrespective of the number of 
balls in the urn, whereas in the lottery case, as the number of available tickets rises, the prob-
ability that a mistaken report will happen upon the number 79 reduces. The urn case would 
become closer to the lottery case if the reporter were under the mistaken impression that the 
balls are all of different colors; then his reporting “white” when in fact the ball is black will 
get less probable as the number of balls increases.

 18. Moreover his talk of “arranging the circumstances so as to secure the independence condi-
tion” is rather bewildering: are we supposed to organize some rigorous experimental setup, 
and then just wait for a miracle to present itself?This page intentionally left blank
