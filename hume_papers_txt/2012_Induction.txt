 HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ 
ABOUT INDUCTION
Peter Millican   
   ‘Is Hume a sceptic about induction?’ This 
might seem to be a fairly straightforward 
question,  but its appearance is misleading,  and 
the appropriate response is not to give a direct 
answer , but instead to move to a more funda-
mental question which is suggested by Hume 
himself at the beginning of his definitive dis-
cussion of scepticism in  Enquiry   Section 12: 
‘What is meant by a sceptic?’ (EHU 12.2 / 
159).  His point here is that ‘sceptic’ can mean 
many things,  and what counts as ‘sceptical’ 
will often depend on the relevant contrast.  
Someone who is sceptical about morality or 
the existence of God,  for example,  need not 
be sceptical about the external world.  And 
someone who is sceptical about the  rational 
basis  of inductive inference need not be scep-
tical at all – in the sense of dismissive or crit-
ical – about the practice itself.  
 This crucial point about the varieties of 
scepticism is often overlooked in discussions 
of Hume on induction,  generating a great 
deal of misunderstanding.  Commonly , the 
debate will be framed in terms of a simple 
contest between ‘sceptical’ and ‘non-scep-
tical’ interpretations.  Then on the one side,  
a case is made drawing on Hume’ s famous 
negative argument which apparently denies 
induction any basis in ‘reason’.  1   Meanwhile,  on the other side,  appeal is made to Hume’ s 
writings as a whole – including the  Treatise , 
 Essays ,  Enquiries ,  Dissertations ,  History   
and  Dialogues  – which display a clear com-
mitment to induction,  and even reveal their 
author to be a fervent advocate of inductive 
science.  The evidence on each side is then 
judiciously weighed,  and an appropriate con-
clusion drawn depending on which way the 
balance falls.  But this whole procedure is mis-
directed,  because once we recognize the varie-
ties of scepticism,  it becomes clear that  these 
two bodies of evidence are not in conflict .  
  1. A SCEPTIC AL ARGUMENT , WITH 
A NON-SCEPTIC AL OUTCOME 
 In this chapter , I shall maintain that Hume’ s 
argument concerning induction is indeed a  
sceptical argument,  in the sense of showing  
that inductive extrapolation from observed  
to unobserved lacks any independent rational  
warrant.  To avoid any misunderstanding  
on the way , however , it will help to be clear  
from the start that this is entirely compatible  
with his wholehearted endorsement of such  
extrapolation as the only legitimate method  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   579780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   57 4/17/2012   3:58:28 PM4/17/2012   3:58:28 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
58for reaching conclusions about ‘any matter  
of fact,  which lies beyond the testimony of  
sense or memory’ (EHU 12.22 / 159).  The 
two may initially seem incompatible,  but if  
so, this is because we are taking for granted  
that a method of inference is to be relied upon  
 only  if it can be given an independent rational  
warrant.  And one of the central messages of  
Hume’ s philosophy is that this assumption is  
itself a rationalist prejudice that we should  
discard,  even though it is shared by both  
the Cartesian dogmatist and the extreme  
‘Pyrrhonian’ sceptic.  In the contest between  
those two extremes,  the Pyrrhonist ‘seems  
to have ample matter of triumph’ while he  
‘justly’ urges Hume’ s own ‘sceptical doubts’ of  
 Enquiry  4 (the famous argument which is then  
summarized at EHU 12.22 / 159).  However , 
the appropriate response,  as Hume himself  
explains,  is not to follow the dogmatist in  
vainly attempting to challenge the argument  
that yields these doubts,  but rather to ask the  
Pyrrhonist: ‘ What his meaning is? And what  
he proposes b y all these curious researc hes? ’ 
(EHU 12.23 / 159).  What,  after all,  does he  
really expect us to do in response to this scep-
tical argument,  even if we fully accept it? Is  
he seriously proposing that we should stop  
drawing inferences about the unobserved?  
That would obviously be absurd:
  a  Pyrrhonian  . . . must acknowledge,  if 
he will acknowledge any thing,  that all 
human life must perish,  were his princi-
ples universally and steadily to prevail.  
All discourse,  all action would immedi-
ately cease; and men remain in a total 
lethargy , till the necessities of nature,  
unsatisfied,  put an end to their miserable 
existence.  (EHU 12.23 / 160)   
 Theoretically , the Pyrrhonist might try to 
deny any such disastrous consequences,  on 
the ground that if induction is unwarranted,  then we have no good reason for supposing 
that human life will indeed perish in these cir -
cumstances.  But Hume suggests that even the 
Pyrrhonist – whatever his theoretical commit-
ments – will be quite unable to insulate him-
self from such common-sense beliefs: ‘Nature 
is always too strong for principle.  . . . the first 
and most trivial event in life will put to flight 
all his doubts and scruples,  and leave him the 
same,  in every point of action and specula-
tion’ with the rest of us (EHU 12.23 / 160).  
 Hume cannot,  of course,   prove  that 
putting total scepticism into practice will lead 
inevitably to disaster , at least not to the sat-
isfaction of the Pyrrhonist who consistently 
refrains from induction.  Nor can he  prove  
that common life will always trump scepti-
cal principle.  But  if in f act  Hume’ s inductive 
conclusions about human psychology are 
correct,  then he does not need to prove these 
points to any such opponent:
  Nature,  by an absolute and uncontroula-
ble necessity has determin’d us to judge 
as well as to breathe and feel; nor can 
we any more forbear [making inductive 
inferences],  than we can hinder ourselves 
from thinking as long as we are awake,  
or seeing the surrounding bodies,  when 
we turn our eyes towards them in broad 
sunshine.  Whoever has taken the pains to 
refute the cavils of this  total  scepticism,  
has really disputed without an antagonist,  
and endeavour’d by arguments to estab-
lish a faculty , which nature has anteced-
ently implanted in the mind,  and render’d 
unavoidable.  (THN 1.4.1.7 / 183)   
 So  if in f act  the sceptic’ s doubts will be spon-
taneously ‘put to flight’ as soon as common 
life intrudes,  then Hume’ s point is practic-
ally successful even if theoretically unproved.  
And recall again that  Hume himself need 
not be committed to accepting onl y what is 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   589780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   58 4/17/2012   3:58:28 PM4/17/2012   3:58:28 PM59HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
theoreticall y prov able  – that is the very preju-
dice which he is aiming to undermine.  
 Hume’ s subtle approach to scepticism 
is made harder to appreciate by the vigour 
and rhetoric of some of his negative argu-
ments and conclusions (especially in the 
 Treatise , where his ultimate position on 
scepticism remains relatively obscure),  but 
also, I suspect,  by the widespread tradition 
of approaching scepticism initially through 
Descartes’ s  Meditations . Descartes sees the 
sceptic as an opponent to be refuted out-
right,  through rational argument of such 
overwhelming force as to be immune to any 
possible doubt.  He thus takes on the onus of 
providing an ultimate justification of human 
reason,  with any ineradicable doubt telling 
in favour of his sceptical opponent.  Hume 
succinctly points out the fundamental flaw 
in this approach immediately after having 
raised the question ‘What is meant by a scep-
tic?’ at the beginning of  Enquiry  Section 12:
  There is a species of scepticism,   anteced-
ent  to all study and philosophy , which 
is much inculcated by  Des C artes  . . . 
It recommends an universal doubt .  . . 
of our very faculties; of whose verac-
ity . . . we must assure ourselves,  by a 
chain of reasoning,  deduced from some 
original principle,  which cannot possibly 
be fallacious or deceitful.  But neither is 
there any such original principle,  which 
has a prerogative above others,  that are 
self-evident and convincing: Or if there 
were,  could we advance a step beyond 
it, but by the use of those very faculties,  
of which we are supposed to be already 
diffident.  The  Cartesian  doubt,  there-
fore, were it ever possible to be attained 
by any human creature (as it plainly is 
not) would be entirely incurable; and no 
reasoning could ever bring us to a state 
of assurance and conviction upon any 
subject.  (EHU 12.3 / 149–50)    Such  antecedent scepticism  is utterly unwork-
able, because in refusing to trust our facul-
ties from the start,  we are denying ourselves 
the only tools that could possibly provide 
any solution.  The proper alternative,  Hume 
seems to be saying,  is to accord our faculties 
some initial default authority , and to resort 
to practical scepticism about them only ‘ con-
sequent  to science and enquiry’,  in the event 
that those investigations reveal their ‘falla-
ciousness’ or ‘unfitness’ (EHU 12.5 / 150).  
Thus the onus is shifted onto the sceptic to 
give reasons for mistrusting our faculties,  
and in the case of induction,  that onus is at 
most only partially fulfilled.  Admittedly ,
  The sceptic .  . . seems to have ample mat-
ter of triumph; while he justly insists,  
that all our evidence for any matter of 
fact, which lies beyond the testimony of 
sense or memory , is derived entirely from 
the relation of cause and effect; that we 
have no other idea of this relation than 
that of two objects,  which have been 
frequently  conjoined  together;  2   that we 
have no argument to convince us,  that 
objects,  which have,  in our experience,  
been frequently conjoined,  will likewise,  
in other instances,  be conjoined in the 
same manner; and that nothing leads us 
to this inference but custom or a certain 
instinct of our nature; which it is indeed 
difficult to resist,  but which,  like other 
instincts,  may be fallacious and deceitful.  
(EHU 12.22 / 159)   
 But this result – as we have seen – gives no 
practical basis for scepticism.  Certainly it 
raises a ground for theoretical concern,  and 
highlights ‘the whimsical condition of man-
kind,  who must act and reason and believe; 
though they are not able,  by their most 
diligent enquiry , to satisfy themselves con-
cerning the foundation of these operations’ 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   599780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   59 4/17/2012   3:58:29 PM4/17/2012   3:58:29 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
60(EHU 12.23 / 160).  But unless we are in the 
grip of the rationalist prejudice that Hume 
rejects,  we should not see this lack of theoret-
ical satisfaction as sufficient reason to aban-
don our only respectable method of inference 
about the unobserved.  That would be to take 
the sceptical considerations to a ridiculous 
(and anyway unachievable) extreme.  Instead,  
the appropriate response is less dramatic but 
far more valuable: to recognize our ‘whimsi-
cal condition’ as a ground for modesty about 
the depth and extent of our powers,  and to 
adopt a ‘mitigated scepticism’ which is cor -
respondingly diffident and cautious (EHU 
12.24 / 161–2),  and which confines our atten-
tion to the subjects of common life,  ‘avoiding 
distant and high enquiries’:
  While we cannot give a satisfactory rea-
son, why we believe,  after a thousand 
experiments,  that a stone will fall,  or 
fire burn; can we ever satisfy ourselves 
concerning any determination,  which we 
may form,  with regard to the origin of 
worlds,  and the situation of nature,  from,  
and to eternity? (EHU 12.25 / 162)   
 This sentence is Hume’ s last word on the 
question of inductive scepticism,  and rep-
resents the conclusion of a coherent line of 
thought which can be traced from the begin-
ning of  Enquiry  Section 12,  his most clear and 
explicit – and repeatedly refined –  treatment 
of scepticism as a whole.  So far , then,  we have 
a clear outline of his mature position.   
  2. HUME’S SCEPTIC AL ARGUMENT 
 The main aim of this chapter is to understand 
the logic and significance of Hume’ s famous 
argument,  and in particular its implications for his notion of ‘reason’ and for the rational 
status of inductive inference.  These issues 
are far from straightforward,  partly because 
the argument appears three times in Hume’ s 
works,  with many differences between the 
three presentations – some of them highly 
significant – and clear evidence of a system-
atic development in his views.  But for our 
purposes,  it will be enough here just to high-
light the most salient points.  
   2.1 T HE ARGUMENT  OF THE  TREATISE  
 In the  Treatise , the famous argument occurs 
within the context of Hume’ s rather ram-
bling search for the origin of the idea of 
 necessary connexion , which he has previ-
ously (THN 1.3.2.11 / 77) identified as the 
key component of our idea of causation.  Not 
having ‘any certain view or design’ on how 
to trace the impression(s) that could account 
for this crucial idea,  he sets off to ‘beat about 
all the neighbouring fields’ in the hope that 
something will turn up (THN 1.3.2.12–13 
/ 77–8).  His first such ‘field’ concerns the 
basis of the Causal Maxim ‘that  whatev er 
begins to exist,  must hav e a cause of exist-
ence ’ (THN 1.3.3.1 / 78),  but after conclud-
ing that this Maxim cannot be ‘intuitively or 
demonstratively certain’,  3   he quickly moves 
on to a related question,  ‘ Why we conclude,  
that suc h particular causes must necessar -
ily hav e suc h particular effects,  and wh y we 
form an inference from one to another?  ’ 
(THN 1.3.3.8–9 / 82).  He soon narrows his 
focus onto what he considers the paradigm 
case of a causal inference,  from a sensory 
 impression  of one ‘object’ (for example,  we 
see a flame),  to forming a belief – a lively 
 idea  – of its effect or cause (for example,  we 
expect heat).  He then analyses such an infer -
ence into its component parts: ‘ First , The 
original impression.   Secondl y , The transition 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   609780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   60 4/17/2012   3:58:29 PM4/17/2012   3:58:29 PM61HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
to the idea of the connected cause or effect.  
 Thirdl y , The nature and qualities of that 
idea’ (THN 1.3.5.1 / 84).  The remainder of 
Section 1.3.5 discusses the first component,  
then 1.3.6,  entitled ‘Of the Inference from the 
Impression to the Idea’,  comes to the second 
component,  the causal inference itself.  4   
 Hume’ s first move,  in discussing this 
paradigm causal inference,  is to insist that it 
cannot be made a priori,  simply from obser -
vation of the cause:
  There is no object,  which implies the 
existence of any other if we consider 
these objects in themselves,  and never 
look beyond the ideas which we form of 
them.  Such an inference .  . . wou’d imply 
the absolute contradiction and impossi-
bility of conceiving any thing different.  
But as all distinct ideas are separable,  
’tis evident there can be no impossibil-
ity of that kind.  When we pass from a 
present impression to the idea of any 
object,  we might possibly have separated 
the idea from the impression,  and have 
substituted any other idea in its room.  
(THN 1.3.6.1 / 86–7)   
 Here Hume is appealing to the principle that 
if an inference is to be a priori,  there must 
be an  absolute contr adiction and impossi-
bility  of conceiving things as turning out 
differently: an a priori inference has to yield 
total certainty . He also seems to be taking for 
granted that such a contradiction in concep-
tion implies a contradiction in fact,  which is 
closely related to his Conceivability Principle 
that  whatev er we concei ve is possible  (this 
makes a more explicit entrance shortly , at 
THN 1.3.6.5 / 89).  Note also his appeal to 
what is commonly called his Separability 
Principle,  that ‘all distinct ideas are separ -
able’ (cf.  THN 1.1.3.4 / 10,  1.1.7.3 / 18–19,  
1.3.3.3 / 79–80),  which plays a major role in the  Treatise  but disappears from his later 
writings.  5   
 Hume has now established one of the 
most important results of his philosophy: 
‘’Tis . . . by  experience  only , that we can 
infer the existence of one object from that of 
another .’ (THN 1.3.6.2 / 87).  And he imme-
diately goes on to explain that the kind of 
experience which prompts such a causal 
inference is repeated conjunctions of pairs of 
‘objects .  . . in a regular order of contiguity 
and succession’.  Where we have repeatedly 
seen  A  closely followed by  B , ‘we call the 
one  cause  and the other  effect , and infer the 
existence of the one from that of the other’.  
Hume enthusiastically trumpets this relation 
of  constant conjunction  as the sought-for key 
to the crucial notion of necessary connexion,  
with a clear allusion back from THN 1.3.6.3 
/ 87 to 1.3.2.11 / 77,  6   and he celebrates the 
progress of his rambling journey of discov-
ery. Admittedly there is still some way to go,  
because mere repetition of conjunctions does 
not seem to generate ‘any new original idea,  
such as that of a necessary connexion’.  But 
the line of investigation seems clear:
  having found,  that after the discovery of  
the constant conjunction  of any objects,  
we always draw an inference from one  
object to another , we shall now examine  
the nature of that inference .  . . Perhaps  
’twill appear in the end,  that the neces-
sary connexion  depends on the inference,  
instead of the inference’ s depending on the  
necessary connexion.  (THN 1.3.6.3 / 88)    
 This last sentence provides an elegant 
 epitome of the link between Hume’ s theories 
of induction and causation,  anticipating the 
eventual outcome of his quest for the elusive 
impression of necessary connexion (which 
will come much later , at THN 1.3.14.20 / 
164–5).  For present purposes,  however , we 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   619780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   61 4/17/2012   3:58:29 PM4/17/2012   3:58:29 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
62can forget about that quest,  and focus on the 
nature of inductive inference.  
 Having established that causal inference 
‘from the impression to the idea’ (e.g.  from 
seeing  A  to expecting  B ) depends on experi-
ence,  Hume goes on to pose the central ques-
tion that his argument aims to answer , namely 
which  mental f aculty  is responsible for the 
inference: ‘the next question is,  Whether 
experience produces the idea by means of the 
understanding or imagination; whether we 
are determin’d by reason to make the tran-
sition,  or by a certain association and rela-
tion of perceptions?’ (THN 1.3.6.4 / 88–9).  
  If the faculty of  reason  were responsible,  
Hume says,  this would have to be on the basis  
of an assumption of similarity between past  
and future,  commonly called his Uniformity  
Principle: ‘If reason determin’d us,  it wou’d  
proceed upon that principle,   that instances,  of 
which we hav e had no experience,  must resem-
ble those,  of whic h we hav e had experience,  
and that the cour se of nature continues alw ays 
uniforml y the same. ’ (THN 1.3.6.4 / 89).    So 
the next stage is to see whether there is any 
argument by which reason could establish 
this principle,  and if there is not,  then Hume 
will conclude that reason cannot be the basis 
for our inductive inferences.  
 Following the standard categoriza-
tion deriving from John Locke,  7   just two 
types of argument are potentially available,  
 demonstr ative  and  probable , and Hume 
now eliminates each in turn.  First,   demon-
strative  arguments proceed with absolute 
certainty based on self-evident (‘intuitive’) 
relationships between the ideas concerned; 
these sorts of argument are capable of yield-
ing ‘knowledge’ in the strict sense,  and are 
mostly confined to mathematics.  8   But no such 
argument can possibly prove the Uniformity 
Principle,  because that would mean the prin-
ciple is absolutely guaranteed,  which the Conceivability Principle shows it cannot be: 
‘We can at least conceive a change in the 
course of nature; which sufficiently proves,  
that such a change is not absolutely impos-
sible.  To form a clear idea of any thing,  is an 
undeniable argument for its possibility , and 
is alone a refutation of any pretended dem-
onstration against it’ (THN 1.3.6.5 / 89).  As 
for  probable  arguments (that is,  arguments in 
which we draw conclusions – typically about 
things in the world of our everyday experi-
ence – with less than total certainty),  these 
must be based on causal relations,  because 
causation is ‘The only .  . . relation of objects 
. . . on which we can found a just inference 
from one object to another’ (THN 1.3.6.7 / 
89).  9   But Hume has just argued that causal 
inference is ‘founded on the presumption of a 
resemblance betwixt those objects,  of which 
we have had experience,  and those,  of which 
we have had none’ (an argument that he reca-
pitulates at THN 1.3.6.6–7 / 89–90,  echoing 
the discussion of THN 1.3.4.1–4 / 82–9).  10   
And since probable inference relies on causal 
relations,  ‘’tis impossible this presumption 
[of the Uniformity Principle] can arise from 
probability’,  on pain of  circularity .  11   So 
neither demonstrative nor probable argu-
ments can provide any solid basis for the 
Uniformity Principle,  and Hume quickly 
concludes that  reason  cannot be responsible 
for causal inference:  12  
  Thus not only our reason fails us in the 
discovery of the  ultimate connexion  of 
causes and effects,  but even after experi-
ence has inform’d us of their  constant con-
junction , ’tis impossible for us to satisfy 
ourselves by our reason,  why we shou’d 
extend that experience beyond those 
particular instances,  which have fallen 
under our observation.  We suppose,  but 
are never able to prove,  that there must 
be a resemblance betwixt those objects,

of which we have had experience,  and 
those which lie beyond the reach of our 
discovery . (THN 1.3.6.11 / 91–2)   
 Instead,  such inference must derive from asso-
ciative principles in the  imagination  (THN 
1.3.6.12 / 92),  and in particular , from a mech-
anism which Hume calls  custom  (e.g.  THN 
1.3.7.6 / 97,  1.3.8.10 / 102) or  habit  (e.g.  
THN 1.3.10.1 / 118).  Experience of constant 
conjunction between  A  and  B  establishes an 
associative connexion between them,  mak-
ing our mind habitually move easily from 
the idea of one to the idea of the other . When 
we then see an  A , the ‘force and vivacity’ of 
that sense impression is transferred through 
the associative link to our idea of  B , enliven-
ing it into a belief.  Hume accordingly goes on 
to define a belief as ‘ a livel y idea rela ted 
to or a ssocia ted with a present impres-
sion ’ (THN 1.3.7.5 / 96),  and to expand on 
this theory of belief formation over the sub-
sequent sections.   
   2.2 F ROM THE  TREATISE   TO THE  ABSTR ACT 
 Given the fame that it has subsequently 
enjoyed,  Hume’ s argument in  Treatise  1.3.6 
is surprisingly inconspicuous.  It occurs within 
a detour (at THN 1.3.3.9 / 82) from a ram-
ble through fields (THN 1.3.2.13 / 77–8); the 
core of it occupies only six fairly short para-
graphs (1–2 / 86–7 and 4–7 / 88–90); and its 
primary role seems to be to identify  custom  
as the ground of causal belief – as a compo-
nent in Hume’ s larger theory of belief – rather 
than to emphasize its own apparently scep-
tical conclusion.  He does later remark on the 
striking nature of this conclusion:  13  
  Let men be once fully perswaded of these 
two principles,   that there is nothing in 
any object,  consider’ d in itself , whic h can afford us a reason for dr awing a conclu-
sion be yond it; and,  that ev en after the 
observ ation of the frequent or constant 
conjunction of objects,  we hav e no rea-
son to dr aw an y inference concerning an y 
object be yond those of whic h we hav e had 
experience  ; . . . and this will throw them 
so loose from all common systems,  that 
they will make no difficulty of receiving 
any, which may appear the most extraor -
dinary . (THN 1.3.12.20 / 139)   
 But this again is within a context where his 
aim is to develop his theory of belief,  now 
focusing on inferences involving  probability  
where the relevant past conjunctions are not 
constant.  
 Books 1 and 2 of the  Treatise  were pub-
lished at the end of January 1739,  but well 
before the end of that year , Hume seems to 
have radically reassessed the significance of 
his philosophy . By then he had written his 
 Abstr act  of the  Treatise , which appeared 
in print in March 1740,  and which devotes 
8 paragraphs out of 35 (paragraphs 8 and 
10–16) to the famous argument.  From being 
a very small part of a much larger system,  
suddenly it becomes the prime focus of 
his philosophy , as it remained in the first 
 Enquiry  of 1748,  which can indeed be seen 
as mainly constructed around the argument 
and its implications.  
 The declared purpose of the argument in 
the  Abstr act  is to understand ‘all reasonings 
concerning  matter of f act ’ (Abs.  8 / 649),  
rather than limiting discussion to the para-
digm case of a causal inference – ‘the infer -
ence from the impression to the idea’ – which 
had been the topic of  Treatise  1.3.6.  But 
Hume then immediately states that all such 
 factual reasonings   (to coin a shorthand term) 
‘are founded on the relation of cause and 
effect’,  thus making clear that causal infer -
ence is still the focus.  However , this initial 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   639780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   63 4/17/2012   3:58:30 PM4/17/2012   3:58:30 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
64move is helpful in both emphasizing the gen-
erality of the argument and also streamlining 
it, avoiding the need for the recapitulation of 
his treatment of causal reasoning which had 
occupied THN 1.3.6.6–7 / 89–90.  Now , in 
proving that all causal reasoning presupposes 
the Uniformity Principle,  he will have proved 
at the same time that ‘all reasoning concern-
ing  matter of f act ’ – and hence all  probable  
reasoning – has such a dependence.  14   
 To facilitate discussion,  Hume introduces 
the simple example of one billiard ball strik-
ing another and causing it to move (Abs.  9–10 
/ 649–50).  He then presents a vivid thought-
experiment,  imagining the first man Adam,  
newly created by God,  and confronted with 
such an imminent collision:
  without experience,  he would never be 
able to infer motion in the second ball 
from the motion and impulse of the 
first. It is not any thing that reason sees 
in the cause,  which makes us  infer  the 
effect.  Such an inference,  were it possi-
ble, would amount to a demonstration,  
as being founded merely on the compari-
son of ideas.  But no inference from cause 
to effect amounts to a demonstration.  
Of which there is this evident proof.  The 
mind can always  concei ve  any effect to 
follow from any cause,  and indeed any 
event to follow upon another: what-
ever we  concei ve  is possible,  at least in a 
metaphysical sense: but wherever a dem-
onstration takes place,  the contrary is 
impossible,  and implies a contradiction.  
There is no demonstration,  therefore,  
for any conjunction of cause and effect.  
(Abs.  11 / 650–1)   
 Compared to the equivalent passage in the 
 Treatise  (THN 1.3.6.1 / 86–7),  this is clearer 
and more straightforward,  proving by dir -
ect appeal to the Conceivability Principle 
a general lesson which he states even more forthrightly elsewhere: ‘that to consider the 
matter  a priori , any thing may produce any 
thing’ (THN 1.4.5.30 / 247,  cf. 1.3.15.1 / 
173, EHU 12.29 / 164).  
 So experience is necessary to ground any 
causal inference (and hence any inference 
‘concerning  matter of f act ’). And Hume goes 
on to explain that the type of experience rel-
evant to his thought-experiment would be of 
‘several instances’ (Abs.  12 / 651) in which 
Adam saw the collision of one ball into 
another followed by motion in the second 
ball. Such experience would condition him 
‘to form a conclusion suitable to his past 
experience’,  and thus to expect more of the 
same.  ‘It follows,  then,  that all reasonings 
concerning cause and effect,  are founded 
on experience,  and that all reasonings from 
experience are founded on the supposition,  
that the course of nature will continue uni-
formly the same’.  (Abs.  13 / 651).  So as in 
the  Treatise , we reach Hume’ s Uniformity 
Principle,  and he now proceeds accordingly 
to consider what rational basis this principle 
could be given:
  ’Tis evident,  that  Adam  . . . would never 
have been able to  demonstr ate , that the 
course of nature must continue uni-
formly the same,  and that the future 
must be conformable to the past.  What 
is possible can never be demonstrated to 
be false; and ’ tis possible the course of 
nature may change,  since we can con-
ceive such a change.  (Abs.  14 / 651)   
 As in the  Treatise , we have an appeal to 
the Conceivability Principle to show that a 
change in the course of nature is possible,  
which in turn implies that uniformity cannot 
be demonstrated.
  Nay, . . . [  Adam ] could not so much as  
prove by any  probable  arguments,  that the  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   649780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   64 4/17/2012   3:58:30 PM4/17/2012   3:58:30 PM65HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
future must be conformable to the past.  
All probable arguments are built on the  
supposition,  that there is this conformity  
betwixt the future and the past,  and there-
fore can never prove it.  This conformity is  
a  matter of f act , and if it must be proved,  
will admit of no proof but from experi-
ence. But our experience in the past can  
be a proof of nothing for the future,  but 
upon a supposition,  that there is a resem-
blance betwixt them.  This therefore is a  
point,  which can admit of no proof at all,  
and which we take for granted without  
any proof.  (Abs.  14 / 651–2)    
 Here the logical circularity of attempting to  
give a probable argument for the Uniformity  
Principle is more explicitly spelled out than  
in the  Treatise.  With both demonstrative and  
probable argument eliminated,  Hume briskly  
concludes that ‘We are determined by  custom  
alone to suppose the future conformable to the  
past. . . . ’Tis not,  therefore,  reason,  which is the  
guide of life,  but custom’ (Abs.  15–16 / 652).  15    
   2.3 T HE ARGUMENT  OF THE  ENQUIRY  
 In the  Enquiry concerning Human  
Under standing  of 1748,  the famous negative  
argument occupies virtually all of Section 4,  
with the positive account in terms of  custom   
appearing in Section 5.  Compared with the  
versions in the  Treatise  and  Abstr act , the 
argument is clarified and greatly expanded,  
leaving little doubt that Hume considers this  
his definitive presentation.  
 Section 4 starts with an important dis-
tinction now commonly known as ‘Hume’ s 
Fork’,  between  relations of ideas  – that is,  
propositions (notably from mathematics) 
that can be known to be true a priori,  just by 
examining and reasoning with the ideas con-
cerned – and  matter s of f act  – that is,  propo-
sitions whose truth or falsehood depends on how the world is,  and so can be known (if at 
all) only through experience.  Some matters of 
fact we learn directly by perception,  and can 
later recall.  16   But what of the rest? Hume sets 
himself to address this key question: ‘what 
is the nature of that evidence,  which assures 
us of any real existence and matter of fact,  
beyond the present testimony of our senses,  
or the records of our memory’ (EHU 4.3 / 
26)? On what basis do we infer from what we 
perceive and remember , to conclusions about 
further , unobserved,  matters of fact? 
 Hume calls such inferences ‘reasonings 
concerning matter of fact’ (EHU 4.4 / 26),  
a term we saw introduced just once in the 
 Abstr act  but which now becomes his stand-
ard way of referring to what he had pre-
viously called ‘probable arguments’.  The 
reason for this terminological adjustment 
seems to be to avoid the infelicity of calling 
such inferences merely ‘probable’ even when 
they are based on vast and totally uniform 
past experience that yields complete ‘moral 
certainty’ (that is,  practical assurance).  In a 
footnote to the heading of Section 6,  Hume 
will accordingly draw a distinction – within 
the class of ‘reasonings concerning matter of 
fact’ – between  probabilities  and  proofs , the 
latter being ‘such arguments from experience 
as leave no room for doubt or opposition’,  as 
when we conclude that ‘all men must die,  or 
that the sun will rise to-morrow’.  17   
 In  Enquiry  4, the famous argument now  
proceeds much as it had in the  Abstr act , albeit  
greatly filled out.  The appendix to this chap-
ter lays out a structure diagram involving 20  
stages,  18   with the stages numbered accord-
ing to the logic of the argument.  The same  
numbers will be followed here,  within square  
brackets,  to enable easy cross-referencing.  
First,  we learn that [2] ‘All reasonings concern-
ing matter of fact seem to be founded on the  
relation of  Cause and Effect  ’ (EHU 4.4 / 26),  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   659780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   65 4/17/2012   3:58:30 PM4/17/2012   3:58:30 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
66since [1] ‘By means of that relation alone we  
can go beyond the evidence of our memory  
and senses’.  As in the  Abstr act , starting in this  
way has the virtue of streamlining the argu-
ment that follows,  so that conclusions then  
drawn about  causal  reasoning will automati-
cally apply to the entire class of  factual  reason-
ing. The first of these conclusions,  as before,  is 
that [5] all knowledge of causal relations must  
be founded on experience: ‘the knowledge  
of this relation [i.e.  causation] is not,  in any  
instance,  attained by reasonings  a priori ; but 
arises entirely from experience,  when we find,  
that any particular objects are constantly con-
joined with each other’.  (EHU 4.6 / 27).  Again  
we get a thought-experiment involving Adam,  
but this time with water and fire,  illustrat-
ing the general truth that [3] ‘No object ever  
discovers [i.e.  reveals],  by the qualities which  
appear to the senses,  either the causes which  
produced it,  or the effects which will arise  
from it’.  This is relatively easy to see when the  
phenomena are untypical or unfamiliar , such  
as the unexpected adhesion between smooth  
slabs of marble,  the explosion of gunpow-
der, or the powers of a (magnetic) lodestone,  
where we have no temptation to imagine  
that we could have predicted these effects  
in advance (EHU 4.7 / 28).  But with com-
monplace occurrences,  such as the impact of  
billiard balls (EHU 4.8 / 28–9),  we might sup-
pose that the effect was foreseeable a priori.  
To prove that this is an illusion,  Hume asks us  
to imagine how we could possibly proceed to  
make such an a priori inference,  arguing that  
we could not,  on the grounds that the effect is  
a quite distinct event from the cause (EHU 4.9  
/ 29),  while many different possible effects  
are equally conceivable (EHU 4.10 / 29–30).  
Summing up [4]:
  every effect is a distinct event from 
its cause.  It could not,  therefore,  be discovered in the cause,  and the first 
invention or conception of it,   a priori , 
must be entirely arbitrary . And even after 
it is suggested,  the conjunction of it with 
the cause must appear equally arbitrary; 
since there are always many other effects,  
which,  to reason,  must seem fully as con-
sistent and natural.  (EHU 4.11 / 30)   
 Note the strong emphasis on  arbitr ariness , 
making clear that it is not just the  concei v-
ability  – or mere theoretical possibility – of 
alternative outcomes which makes any a pri-
ori inference from cause to effect impossible; 
it is the fact that from an a priori point of 
view, there is nothing to suggest one outcome 
over another .  19   
 If causal relations cannot be known a pri-
ori, then factual inference cannot be a pri-
ori either (given [2] that factual inference is 
founded on causation).  [6] ‘In vain,  therefore,  
should we pretend to determine any single 
event .  . . without the assistance of observation 
and experience’.  Hume now brings Part 1 of 
Section 4 to a close,  with two very impor -
tant corollaries for his philosophy of science.  
The first is that since we cannot aspire to a 
priori insight into why things work as they 
do, the appropriate ambition for science is 
instead to aim more modestly for  systemati-
zation  of those cause and effect relationships 
that experience reveals: ‘to reduce the prin-
ciples,  productive of natural phænomena,  to 
a greater simplicity , and to resolve the many 
particular effects into a few general causes,  
by means of reasonings from analogy , experi-
ence,  and observation’.  (EHU 4.12 / 30).  Then 
follows Hume’ s most explicit account of 
applied mathematics (which he calls ‘mixed 
mathematics’),  emphasizing that although 
mathematical relationships are a priori,  the 
laws through which they are applied to the 
world – his example is the Newtonian law of 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   669780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   66 4/17/2012   3:58:30 PM4/17/2012   3:58:30 PM67HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
conservation of momentum – remain unam-
biguously a posteriori: ‘the discovery of the 
law itself is owing merely to experience,  and 
all the abstract reasonings in the world could 
never lead us one step towards the knowl-
edge of it’ (EHU 4.13 / 31).  20   
 Part 2 starts by summarizing Hume’ s 
results so far , and anticipating his eventual 
conclusion [20]:
  When it is asked,   What is the nature 
of all our reasonings concerning mat-
ter of f act?  the proper answer seems to 
be, that they are founded on the rela-
tion of cause and effect.  When again it 
is asked,   What is the foundation of all 
our reasonings and conclusions concern-
ing that relation?  it may be replied in one 
word,   Experience . But if we still carry 
on our sifting humour , and ask,   What is 
the foundation of all conclusions from 
experience?  this implies a new question 
. . . I shall content myself,  in this section,  
with an easy task,  and shall pretend [i.e.  
aspire] only to give a negative answer to 
the question here proposed.  I say then,  
that, even after we have experience of 
the operations of cause and effect,  our 
conclusions from that experience are  not  
founded on reasoning,  or any process of 
the understanding.  (EHU 4.14–15 / 32)   
 Having established that experience is required 
for any factual inference,  Hume goes on to 
explain how experience plays that role:
  we always presume,  when we see like sen-
sible qualities,  that they have like secret 
powers,  21   and expect,  that effects,  simi-
lar to those which we have experienced,  
will follow from them.  . . . But why [past] 
experience should be extended to future 
times,  and to other objects,  which for 
aught we know , may be only in appear -
ance similar; this is the main question  .  . . 
(EHU 4.16 / 33–4; emphasis added)    This passage seems to be saying that [7] when 
we draw conclusions from past experience,  
we presuppose a resemblance between the 
observed and the unobserved,  extrapolating 
from one to the other .  22   Later , when appar -
ently referring back to this passage,  Hume 
confirms such a reading: ‘We have said,  . . . 
that all our experimental conclusions pro-
ceed upon the supposition,  that the future 
will be conformable to the past’ (EHU 4.19 / 
35). So his ‘main question’ at EHU 4.16 / 
34 concerns,  in effect,  the foundation of the 
Uniformity Principle.  23   He repeats (cf.  EHU 
4.6 / 27) that [3] ‘there is no known con-
nexion between the sensible qualities and 
the secret powers’ of any object,  and infers 
from this that [9] ‘the mind is not led to form 
such a conclusion concerning their con-
stant and regular conjunction,  by any thing 
which it knows of their nature’ (EHU 4.16 / 
33). So the Uniformity Principle cannot be 
established on the basis of anything that we 
learn directly through sense perception,  in 
which case [10] any foundation for it will 
have to draw on past experience,  which for 
the sake of the argument can here be taken 
as infallible:  ‘As to past  Experience , it can be 
allowed to give  direct  and  certain  informa-
tion of those precise objects only , and that 
precise period of time,  which fell under its 
cognizance.  . . . (EHU 4.16 / 33).  The ‘main 
question’ is then urged: how to justify the 
step from past experience to the assumption 
of future resemblance?
  These two propositions are far from 
being the same,   I hav e found that suc h 
an object has alw ays been attended with 
such an effect , and  I foresee,  that other 
objects,  whic h are,  in appear ance,  simi-
lar, will be attended with similar effects.   
I shall allow , if you please,  that the one 
proposition may justly be inferred from 
the other: I know in fact,  that it always is 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   679780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   67 4/17/2012   3:58:31 PM4/17/2012   3:58:31 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
68inferred.  But if you insist,  that the infer -
ence is made by a chain of reasoning,  I 
desire you to produce that reasoning.  
The connexion between these propos-
itions is not intuitive.  There is required 
a medium,  which may enable the mind 
to draw such an inference,  if indeed it 
be drawn by reasoning and argument.  
(EHU 4.16 / 34)   
 So because [11] the inference from past 
experience to future resemblance is not  intui-
tive  (i.e. not immediately  self-evident ), [12] 
there must be some  medium , some ‘connect-
ing proposition or intermediate step’ (EHU 
4.17 / 34) if indeed the inference is ‘drawn by 
reasoning and argument’.  24   
 The long paragraph that we have just 
been discussing (EHU 4.16 / 32–4) includes 
steps that have no parallel in the  Treatise  
and  Abstr act , where,  as we saw , Hume sim-
ply takes for granted that if the Uniformity 
Principle is to be rationally well founded,  
then this must be on the basis of some chain 
of reasoning,  either demonstrative or prob-
able. Here in the  Enquiry , he explicitly rules 
out both  sense     experience  and  intuition  as 
sources of foundation for the Uniformity 
Principle,  and only then comes to consider 
 demonstr ation  and  probability , which are in 
turn dismissed in the familiar way , but again 
with the structure of the argument made 
somewhat more explicit:
  [13] All reasonings may be divided into 
two kinds,  namely demonstrative reason-
ing, or that concerning relations of ideas,  
and moral reasoning,  or that concerning 
matter of fact and existence.  25   [15] That 
there are no demonstrative arguments 
in the case,  seems evident; since [14] it 
implies no contradiction,  that the course 
of nature may change,  . . . Now what-
ever is intelligible,  and can be distinctly 
conceived,  implies no contradiction,  and can never be proved false by any demon-
strative argument or abstract reasoning  a 
priori . (EHU 4.18 / 35)   
 As in the  Treatise  and  Abstr act , Hume appeals 
to the Conceivability Principle,  though 
slightly differently: here he expresses it as the 
principle that what is conceivable  implies no 
contr adiction , rather than saying that what is 
conceivable  is possible .  26   Moving on now to 
 probability :
  [16] If we be,  therefore,  engaged by 
arguments to put trust in past experi-
ence,  and make it the standard of our 
future judgment,  these arguments must 
be probable only , or such as regard mat-
ter of fact and real existence,  . . . But 
. . . there is no argument of this kind,  
. . . We have said,  that [2] all arguments 
concerning existence are founded on the 
relation of cause and effect; that [5] our 
knowledge of that relation is derived 
entirely from experience; and that [7] all 
our experimental conclusions proceed 
upon the supposition,  that the future 
will be conformable to the past.  [17] To 
endeavour , therefore,  the proof of this 
last supposition by probable arguments,  
or arguments regarding existence,  must 
be evidently going in a circle,  and taking 
that for granted,  which is the very point 
in question.  (EHU 4.19 / 35–6)   
 Note in passing how Hume just assumes  
here some obvious inferences,  linking [2]  
with [5] to deduce that [6] all factual infer -
ences (‘probable arguments’,  ‘arguments  
concerning existence’) are founded on  
experience,  and then combining this with  
[7] to deduce in turn that [8] all factual  
inferences ‘proceed upon the supposition’  
of the Uniformity Principle.  27   He also now  
leaves the reader to piece together the final  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   689780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   68 4/17/2012   3:58:31 PM4/17/2012   3:58:31 PM69HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
stages of his argument.  28   First,  that since the  
Uniformity Principle cannot be established  
by either demonstrative or factual inference,  
it follows that [18] there is no good argu-
ment for the Uniformity Principle.  Secondly , 
that therefore (given [12]),  29   it follows that  
[19] the Uniformity Principle cannot be  
founded on reason,  and finally , that since  
[8] all factual inferences are founded on the  
Uniformity Principle,  it follows that [20] no  
factual inference (i.e.  no ‘reasoning concern-
ing matter of fact and existence’) is founded  
on reason.  Hume had anticipated this con-
clusion at EHU 4.15,  quoted earlier:  30   ‘I say 
then,  that,  even after we have experience  
of the operations of cause and effect,  our 
conclusions from that experience are  not  
founded on reasoning,  or any process of the  
understanding’ (EHU 4.15 / 32).  Also in the  
following section – most of which is devoted  
to sketching his theory of belief as based on  
‘ Cust om  or  Habit ’ (EHU 5.5 / 43) – Hume  
refers back to this argument and states its  
conclusion explicitly , once purely negatively  
and once alluding to his positive theory:  
‘we .  . . conclude .  . . in the foregoing sec-
tion, that,  in all reasonings from experience,  
there is a step taken by the mind,  which is  
not supported by any argument or process  
of the understanding; .  . .’ (EHU 5.2 / 41);  
‘All belief of matter of fact or real exist-
ence .  . . [is due merely to] .  . . a species of  
natural instincts,  which no reasoning or  
process of the thought and understanding is  
able, either to produce,  or to prevent’ (EHU  
5.8 / 46–7).   
  2.4 T HE ESSENTIAL  CORE OF HUME’S 
SCEPTICAL  ARGUMENT  
 We can now distil the essence of Hume’ s 
argument from these three different presen-
tations,  into eight main stages:     (A)     The argument concerns all inferences 
to matters of fact that we have not 
observed: what the  Enquiry  calls ‘rea-
sonings concerning matter of fact’ (here 
 factual inferences  for short).  Although 
the  Treatise  version starts with a nar -
rower focus on causal inference ‘from 
the impression to the idea’,  it later 
requires the lemma that  all f actual 
inferences are based on causal relations  
(stated at THN 1.3.6.7 / 89).  So the 
argument is improved both structur -
ally and philosophically by starting with 
all factual inferences,  as in the  Abstr act  
and the  Enquiry , and then deriving this 
lemma as its fi  rst main stage (Abs.  8 / 
649; EHU 4.4 / 26–7).   
  (B)     Hume next argues that  causal relations 
cannot be known a priori,  and hence 
are discov erable onl y through experi-
ence  (THN 1.3.6.1 / 86–7,  Abs. 9–11 
/ 649–51; EHU 4.6–11 / 27–30).  This 
is a major principle of his philosophy , 
wielded signifi  cantly elsewhere (e.g.  
THN 1.3.15.1 / 173,  1.4.5.30 / 247–8; 
EHU 12.29 / 164).   
  (C)     From this principle,  together with the 
lemma from (A),  Hume concludes that 
 all factual inferences are founded on 
experience , the relevant experience 
being of those  constant conjunctions   
 through which we discover causal rela-
tionships (THN 1.3.6.2 / 87,  Abs. 12 / 
651; EHU 4.16 / 33).   
  (D)     Factual inferences thus involve  extrapo-
lation from observ ed to unobserv ed, 
based on an assumption of resem-
blance  between the two.  Initially in the  
 Treatise , Hume seems to suggest that  
such an assumption of resemblance –  
 commonly called his Uniformity  
Principle (UP) – would be necessarily  
implicated only if  reason  were respon-
sible for the inference (THN 1.3.6.4 /  
88–9).  But his settled view , expressed in  
all three works (see note 10 above),  is

70inferences ,  31   simply in virtue of their  
taking for granted a resemblance  
between observed and unobserved.   
  (E)     Hume now proceeds to investigate criti-
cally the basis of UP itself.  In the  Treatise   
(THN 1.3.6.4 / 88–9) and  Abstr act  
(Abs.  14 / 651–2),  he appears to assume  
immediately that any foundation in reason  
would have to derive from some  demon-
strative  (i.e. deductive) or  probable  (i.e. 
factual) inference.  In the  Enquiry , how-
ever – which hugely expands this part of  
the argument from the cursory treatment  
in the earlier works – he considers demon-
strative and factual inference only after  
fi rst (EHU 4.16 / 32–4) explicitly ruling  
out any foundation in  sensory aw areness  
of objects’ pow ers , or in immediate  intu-
ition  (i.e. self-evidence).  32    
  (F)     Any demonstrative argument for UP is 
ruled out because a change in the course 
of nature is clearly conceivable and there-
fore possible (THN 1.3.6.5 / 89; Abs. 
14 / 651–2,  EHU 4.18 / 35).  Any factual 
argument for UP is ruled out because,  
as already established at (D),  such argu-
ments inevitably presuppose UP , and 
hence any purported factual inference 
to UP would be viciously circular (THN 
1.3.6.7 / 89–90; Abs. 14 / 651–2; EHU 
4.19 / 35–6).   
  (G)     The upshot of this critical investigation 
is that  UP has no satisf actory founda-
tion in reason , though Hume expresses 
this in various ways:    
 ’tis impossible to satisfy ourselves by 
our reason,  why we shou’d extend 
[our] experience beyond those par -
ticular instances,  which have fallen 
under our observation.  We suppose,  
but are never able to prove,  that there 
must be a resemblance betwixt those 
objects,  of which we have had experi-
ence,  and those which lie beyond 
the reach of our discovery . (THN 
1.3.6.11 / 91–2)  This [resemblance between past and  
future] is a point,  which can admit of  
no proof at all,  and which we take for  
granted without proof.  (Abs.  14 / 652)  
 it is not reasoning which engages us 
to suppose the past resembling the 
future,  and to expect similar effects 
from causes,  which are,  to appear -
ance,  similar . (EHU 4.23 / 39)    
   (H)     Since UP is presupposed  by all factual  
inferences (D),  and UP has no foundation  
in reason (G),  Hume fi  nally concludes  
that  factual inference itself has no foun-
dation in reason . Again he expresses this  
conclusion in various ways (and note  
here the narrower focus of the  Treatise  on 
 causal  inference ‘from the impression to  
the idea’,  as pointed out at (A) above):     
 When the mind .  . . passes from the idea  
or impression of one object to the idea  
or belief of another , it is not determin’d  
by reason (THN 1.3.6.12 / 92)  
 ’Tis not,  therefore,  reason,  which is the 
guide of life,  but custom.  That alone 
determines the mind .  . . to suppose 
the future conformable to the past.  
However easy this step may seem,  
reason would never , to all eternity , be 
able to make it.  (Abs.  16 / 652) 
 I say then,  that,  . . . our conclusions 
from .  . . experience are  not  founded 
on reasoning,  or any process of the 
understanding.  (EHU 4.15 / 32) 
 in all reasonings from experience,  there  
is a step taken by the mind,  which is not  
supported by any argument or process  
of the understanding (EHU 5.2 / 41)    
 Note also that two of these quotations – from 
Abs. 16 / 652 and EHU 5.2 / 41 – could just 
as appropriately have been cited as illustra-
tions of (G),  because both refer to that ‘step’ 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   709780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   70 4/17/2012   3:58:31 PM4/17/2012   3:58:31 PM71HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
which is precisely the presupposition of the 
Uniformity Principle.  Since factual inference 
operates by extrapolation from past to future,  
Hume takes it to be obvious that the founda-
tion of such inference must be the same as the 
foundation of the principle of extrapolation.  
Hence he does not consistently distinguish 
between (G) and (H),  making the last stages 
of his argument less explicit than one might 
wish (cf.  the end of section 2.3 above).    
  3. THE N ATURE OF HUME’S 
SCEPTIC AL CONCLUSION 
 Hume usually expresses the conclusion of his  
famous argument in a way that seems to imply  
some  incapacity  on the part of human reason.  
The Uniformity Principle is something that we  
‘are never able to prove’ (THN 1.3.6.11 / 92),  
and which indeed ‘can admit of no proof at  
all’ (Abs.  14 / 652).  Because of this,  ‘’tis impos-
sible to satisfy ourselves by our reason’ (THN  
1.3.6.11 / 91) concerning the inferential step  
from past to future,  a step which ‘reason  
would never , to all eternity , be able to make’  
(Abs.  16 / 652) and ‘which is not supported by  
any argument or process of the understand-
ing’ (EHU 5.2 / 41).  Hume also frequently  
uses similar terms within the argument itself,  
when saying that various would-be proofs  
of UP are impossible,  refutable,  circular or  
lack any ‘just foundation’ (THN 1.3.6.5 / 89,  
1.3.6.7 / 89–90,  1.3.6.10 / 91; EHU 4.18 / 35,  
19 / 35–6,  21 / 37–8),  denying that human  
knowledge ‘can afford .  . . an argument’ that  
‘supports the understanding’ (EHU 4.17 / 34)  
in reasoning from past to future,  and conse-
quently denying that our factual inferences  
‘are built on solid reasoning’ (THN 1.3.6.8  
/ 90).  In both the  Treatise  (see section 2.2  
above) and  Enquiry  (see section 1),  he later  glosses the conclusion of the argument in  
apparently very negative terms,  as showing  
that ‘ we hav e no reason ’ to draw any factual  
inference (THN 1.3.12.20 / 139),  and that  
‘we cannot give a satisfactory reason,  why we  
believe,  after a thousand experiments,  that a  
stone will fall,  or fire burn’ (EHU 12.25 / 162).  
In this light,  it seems entirely appropriate that  
he should entitle  Enquiry  Section 4 ‘Sceptical  
Doubts concerning the Operations of the  
Understanding’,  and describe it as appearing  
to give the sceptic ‘ample matter of triumph’  
(EHU 12.22 / 159).  
 As discussed earlier , however , the issue 
of Hume’ s inductive ‘scepticism’ is not so 
straightforward,  and it is far from clear that 
he sees the acknowledged incapacity of rea-
son to ‘prove’ or ‘support’ the Uniformity 
Principle as any sort of genuine  problem . 
Certainly he does not infer from it (either 
in the  Treatise , the  Abstr act  or the  Enquiry ) 
that induction is  unreasonable  in any prag-
matic sense.  And indeed the line of thought 
sketched in Section 1 above,  drawing on 
Section 12 of the  Enquiry , somewhat sug-
gests that he considers it inevitable that our 
most basic principles of inference – precisely 
because they are so basic – will lack any ulti-
mate justification  beyond their fundamental 
place in our mental economy . That being so,  
the central upshot of Hume’ s argument might 
be simply to identify the Uniformity Principle 
as a basic principle of this kind,  and the scep-
tical flavour of his reasoning – in demonstrat-
ing reason’ s incapacity to prove UP – need 
not carry over at all into the theory of human 
inference that he draws from it.  Nevertheless,  
the sceptical flavour of the famous argu-
ment itself would remain,  in denying UP a 
source of rational support that more opti-
mistic philosophers might have expected it 
to enjoy . And although the argument also 
delivers the important positive principle that 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   719780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   71 4/17/2012   3:58:32 PM4/17/2012   3:58:32 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
72 the Uniformity Principle is presupposed b y 
all factual inference  (D), even in the  Enquiry  
we have to wait until the final section to see 
this wielded as part of an effective  theoretical  
defence against the ‘Pyrrhonian’ sceptic.  33   
  3.1 D EBATES  ABOUT  HUMEAN  ‘REASON ’ 
 What we get much sooner , of course,  and in  
all three works,  is Hume’ s positive account of  
how our inductive inferences operate through  
 custom  or  habit  – what he calls in the title of  
 Enquiry  Section 5 his ‘sceptical solution’ to the  
earlier ‘sceptical doubts’.  But as David Owen  
observes,  it seems odd to suppose that a  psy-
chological  account of how belief functions  
could in any way ‘solve’ genuine  epistemo-
logical    doubts; Owen accordingly suggests  
that the famous argument is itself best under -
stood as exclusively concerned with psycho-
logical mechanisms,  and as having nothing  
to do with ‘the warrant of probable reason-
ing or the justification of belief ’.  34   The argu-
ment’ s conclusion,  that factual inference is not  
founded on  reason , may initially seem unam-
biguously normative,  but Owen interprets  
‘reason’ here as signifying what he takes to  
be a Lockean conception of  the mec hanism  
by whic h human reasoning oper ates , namely , 
through stepwise inference via  intermediate  
ideas . Thus he is able to read Hume’ s conclu-
sion that factual inference ‘is not determin’d  
by reason’ as purely descriptive: as denying  
that we actually draw factual inferences in the  
stepwise,  mediated manner that Locke suppos-
es.  35   The famous argument accordingly serves  
to  reject  this Lockean conception of probable  
reasoning in favour of the more immediate  
and instinctive Humean model,  thus providing  
a contribution to empirical psychology , rather  
than an exercise in sceptical epistemology . 
 Owen is by no means the first to read 
Hume’ s famous argument as designed to  reject  some non-Humean notion of reason; 
indeed this style of interpretation became 
extremely popular in the 1980s.  Before then,  
the general image of Hume was of a highly 
destructive sceptic,  intending through his 
famous argument to maintain that induc-
tive arguments lack all rational justifica-
tion. Barry Stroud wittily expressed what 
he took to be Hume’ s conclusion: ‘As far as 
the competition for degrees of reasonable-
ness is concerned,  all possible beliefs about 
the unobserved are tied for last place’.  36     
Some of these extreme sceptical interpreta-
tions – most influentially those of Antony  
Flew  37   and David Stove  38   – took Hume to  
be starting from the assumption of  deduc-
tivism , that an inference is rationally justi-
fied only if it is logically guaranteed.  39   But 
deductivism sits very uneasily with the (fal-
lible but reasonable) empirical judgements  
that abound within Hume’ s contributions to  
‘the science of human nature’,  for example  
his discussions of the passions,  his  Essays  
on politics and economics,  and his vari-
ous pieces on religion.  The ‘wise man’ of  
 Enquiry  10.4 / 110,  who ‘proportions his  
belief to the [empirical] evidence’,  clearly  
cannot be a deductivist; hence Flew , in dis-
cussing ‘Of Miracles’,  was forced to accuse  
Hume of ‘flagrant and embarrassing’ incon-
sistency .  40   Even more flagrantly inconsist-
ent, from this perspective,  were the passages  
in which Hume,  after his famous argument  
had apparently denied causal,  factual infer -
ence a place within the realm of ‘reason’,  
then quite explicitly treated it as one of rea-
son’s central operations,  for example:  41   
 with regard to reason .  . . The only con-
clusion we can draw from the existence 
of one thing to that of another , is by 
means of the relation of cause and effect 
(THN 1.4.2.47 / 212) 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   729780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   72 4/17/2012   3:58:32 PM4/17/2012   3:58:32 PM73HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
 reason,  in a strict and philosophical 
sense,  can have an influence on our con-
duct .  . . by informing us of the existence 
of something which is a proper object 
of [a passion]; or when it discovers the 
connexion of causes and effects,  so as to 
afford us means of exerting any passion.  
(THN 3.1.1.12 / 459)   
 But such gross inconsistency was hard to 
credit,  and given Hume’ s evident commit-
ment to inductive moral science (and to its 
reasonableness in comparison with ‘super -
stition’),  it seemed to most later scholars far 
more plausible to interpret his famous argu-
ment not as genuinely sceptical,  but instead 
as a way of  rejecting  or  undermining  the 
deductivist notion of reason on which it was 
thought to be based (by revealing its com-
plete incapacity to underwrite any factual 
inference).  From this it would follow that 
Hume must use the term ‘reason’ in at least 
two distinct senses: one narrowly deductiv-
ist or ‘rationalistic’ notion within the famous 
argument,  and a broader , more ‘naturalistic’ 
notion elsewhere,  such as in his discussions 
of the passions and morality . 
 This  anti-deducti vist  style of interpretation  
was pioneered in 1975 by Tom Beauchamp  
and Thomas Mappes,  42   whose work was  
quickly followed by numerous variations on  
the theme.  43   However it lost favour after I  
and Don Garrett (independently , in 1995 and  
1997)  44   pointed out the implausibility , under  
careful analysis,  of reading Hume’ s argument  
as employing a deductivist notion of rea-
son. Deductivism proves very hard to square  
with the argument’ s logic,  45   and it also seems  
strange – if Hume’ s purpose is to wield the  
argument in order to  reject  the notion of reason  
that it employs – that he should then continue  
to assert its sceptical conclusion in the appar -
ently sincere terms we saw earlier .  46   My own  proposed  alternative was to see the argument  
as presupposing  a  perceptual  model of reason,  
according to which we draw inferences through  
the perception of evidential connexions.  
This had the virtue of identifying a plausible  
(and substantial) target of Hume’ s argument,  
namely , Locke’ s view – complacently assumed  
and stated in his  Essay concerning Human  
Under standing   47   but never worked out in any  
detail – that probable reasoning is founded  
on the  perception  of probable connexions  . 
Against this,  Hume’ s rival model of probable  
inference based on  custom  – and introduced  
immediately after his famous argument had  
refuted the alternative – stood out as a radi-
cal (and highly sceptical) departure.  Moreover  
the ubiquitous hold of the traditional percep-
tual view of reason,  which goes back to the  
ancients and was shared by Hume’ s contem-
poraries,  could help to make sense of his own  
apparent assessment of the famous argument  
as having a significant sceptical impact.  A mere  
denial that induction has  deducti ve  force,  or 
yields  total  certainty , would hardly be worthy  
of notice in the wake of Locke.  48   But denying  
that induction is founded  on perception  of an y 
good reason whatev er  would have vastly more  
sceptical significance.  
 Garrett’ s approach was quite different,  
and in context more radical.  He insisted – 
against the prevailing orthodoxy – that 
Hume employs but a single sense of ‘reason’,  
taking this to be Hume’ s name for ‘the gen-
eral faculty of making inferences or produ-
cing arguments – just as it was for Locke’.  49   
Leaving aside the (debatable) attribution to 
Locke,  50   the obvious advantage of this inter -
pretation was precisely its lack of any need to 
posit an ambiguity in ‘reason’:
  Hume .  . . [is] making a specific claim,  
within cognitive psychology , about the 
relation between our tendency to make 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   739780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   73 4/17/2012   3:58:32 PM4/17/2012   3:58:32 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
74inductive inferences and our inferential/
argumentative faculty: he is arguing that 
we do not adopt induction on the basis 
of recognizing an  argument  for its reli-
ability , for the utterly sufficient reason 
that there  is  no argument (‘reasoning’ 
or ‘process of the understanding’) that 
could have this effect.  . . . this does not 
mean that inductive inferences are not 
themselves  instances  of argumentation 
or reasoning .  . . His point is rather that 
they are reasonings that are not them-
selves produced by any piece of higher 
level reasoning: there is no argument 
that could lead us to accept the conclu-
sion that inductive reasonings will be 
reliable if we did not  alread y  accept that 
conclusion in practice.  Hence,  in just 
this sense,  they are a class of ‘reasonings’ 
(inferences or arguments) that ‘reason’ 
(the faculty of making inferences or giv-
ing arguments) does not itself ‘determine’ 
(cause) us to make.  51     
 Like Owen,  Garrett saw Hume’ s argu-
ment as an exercise in descriptive psych-
ology rather than normative epistemology , 
delivering a result about the  causation  of 
inductive inference rather than its ‘eviden-
tiary value’.  However , this sat uneasily with  
Garrett’ s emphasis (as in the quotation  
above) on the recognition of higher -level  
arguments  for the reliability  of induction,  
and under challenge,  he modified his ori-
ginal reading of Hume’ s conclusion to make  
it more general.  Here are the relevant parts  
of the passage above,  edited to reflect the  
adjusted reading:  52  
  Hume .  . . [is] making a specific claim,  
. . . about the underlying causal mechan-
ism that gives rise to inductive inferences: 
namely , that it is not itself dependent on 
any reasoning or inference.  . . . His point is . . . that [inductive inferences] are rea-
sonings which are not themselves  caused  
by any piece of reasoning (including,  of 
course,  themselves).  Inductive inferences 
require that we bridge a gap between 
observation and prediction,  and for 
someone not already disposed by nature 
to bridge that gap,  no argument for doing 
so would be persuasive.  Hence,  . . .  53     
 One surprising effect of this change was to  
bring Garrett’ s interpretation rather close to  
Owen’ s, because his detailed analysis of how  
mediated inferences operate made them  ipso 
facto  inferences that are ‘determin’d by rea-
son’. On this account,  a demonstrative infer -
ence from  A  to  D , mediated by the intuitive  
connexions of  A  to  B ,  B  to  C , and  C  to  D , will 
include as part of its processing the intermedi-
ate inference connecting  B  to  D .  54   This makes  
the latter inference,  according to Garrett,  a 
 cause  of the overall inference from  A  to  D ; 
hence that overall inference is ‘determin’d by  
reason’ in the sense of being  caused  by another  
inference.  Thus Garrett agrees with Owen  
that Hume’ s conclusion involves a denial  
that induction proceeds by  stepwise r atiocin-
ation . All this may seem somewhat artificial,  
and increasingly distant from anything to be  
found in Hume’ s text,  but it has the nice fea-
ture of accommodating a genuinely Humean  
point – that probable inference is characteris-
tically immediate and instinctive rather than  
mediated and reflective – within a framework  
which,  unlike Owen’ s, avoids any need to treat  
the notion of ‘reason’ that is operative in the  
famous argument as one that Hume  rejects . 
Garrett has consistently urged this last point  
against rival interpretations: that Hume’ s 
famous argument gives little internal clue that  
he is employing some special notion of reason  
which he aims to reject.  And although both  
Owen and I sought to mitigate the impact of  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   749780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   74 4/17/2012   3:58:32 PM4/17/2012   3:58:32 PM75HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
this criticism on our interpretations (by stress-
ing that we saw Hume’ s response to the argu-
ment as changing not the  scope  of his notion  
of reason,  but rather its  presumed method  
of oper ation ),  55   the lack of any obvious and  
deliberate ambiguity or equivocation on  
Hume’ s part has remained by far the strongest  
weapon in Garrett’ s armoury . 
 Garrett’ s interpretation has also seemed 
attractive for a more specious reason,  
namely , the extent to which Hume expresses 
his conclusion in terms of the impossibility 
of founding induction on ‘reasoning’ (e.g.  
THN 1.3.6.8 / 90; EHU 4.15 / 32,  4.16 / 34,  
4.23 / 39),  ‘proof ’ (e.g.  THN 1.3.6.11 / 92; 
Abs. 14 / 651–2),  or ‘argument’ (e.g.  Abs. 15 
/ 652; EHU 4.16–17 / 34–5,  4.21–3 / 38–9,  
5.2 / 41).  Today we read these terms as sig-
nifying complex inference involving inter -
mediate steps,  but in Hume’ s day they were 
understood rather differently . Johnson’ s dic-
tionary of 1756 tells us that ‘reasoning’ is 
derived from ‘reason’,  and defines it simply 
as ‘argument’.  56   The first sense of ‘argument’ 
is given as ‘A reason alleged for or against any 
thing’,  and Johnson implicitly confirms that 
he takes this as its primary sense in specify-
ing – as one of the  non-discur sive  senses of 
‘reason’ – ‘Argument; ground of persuasion; 
motive’.  Likewise the first sense of ‘proof ’ 
is given as ‘Evidence; testimony; convincing 
token’,  supplemented in later editions by 
the clauses ‘convincing argument; means of 
conviction’.  The words that Johnson favours 
for stepwise inference are ‘deduction’ and 
‘ratiocination’,  57   as in the specification of 
the two  discur sive  senses of ‘reason’: ‘The 
power by which man deduces one propos-
ition from another , or proceeds from prem-
ises to consequences’,  and ‘Ratiocination; 
discursive power’.  These both contrast with 
‘intuition’,  which is ‘Knowledge not obtained 
by deduction of reason’,  and ‘intuitive’,  which means ‘Having the power of discov-
ering truth immediately without ratiocin-
ation’.  All this seems to fit with Hume’ s own 
usage: he refers to ‘deductions’ and ‘ratiocin-
ation’ in contexts where stepwise argument 
is clearly intended (e.g.  THN 1.3.14.2 / 156,  
EHU 5.22 / 55,  EPM 1.4 / 170; EHU 4.23 
/ 39, 12.17 / 155),  and he is happy to refer 
to ‘arguments’,  ‘inference’ and ‘proof ’ that 
are ‘intuitive’,  and hence do not proceed in 
a stepwise fashion (THN 1.3.14.35 / 173,  
2.3.2.2 / 408; EHU 4.21 / 37,  8.22n18 / 94n,  
LDH 1.187,  91).  58   Overall,  therefore,  the lan-
guage in which Hume expresses his famous 
conclusion is no argument ( sic .) in favour of 
Garrett’ s interpretation.  
 Perhaps the most serious problem for 
Garrett’ s interpretation,  as for Owen’ s, has 
been in making sense of the logic of Hume’ s 
famous argument.  For as we have seen,  that 
argument does not in fact put much emphasis 
on  a gener al absence of stepwise processing 
or ratiocination   within inductive inference.  59   
Instead,  it focuses on the very specific step of 
extrapolation from observed to unobserved – 
that is,  the supposition of the Uniformity 
Principle (UP) – and then it attacks in turn 
the props on which that principle ‘may be 
suppos’d to be founded’,  showing that none 
of them can ‘afford any just conclusion of this 
nature’ (THN 1.3.6.4 / 90).  This move makes 
perfect sense on an  epistemological   interpret-
ation of the argument,  because if  any  essen-
tial evidential step in an inductive inference 
lacks a ‘just foundation’,  then the inference 
as a whole will,  apparently , be undermined.  60   
On the Garrett/Owen style of  psychological   
interpretation,  however , the move looks 
almost irrelevant –  even if  it sufficed to show 
that UP is not itself reached through mediated 
ratiocination,  that would not exclude such 
ratiocination from playing some  other   role 
within inductive inference.  This objection can 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   759780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   75 4/17/2012   3:58:32 PM4/17/2012   3:58:32 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
76be sharpened by posing a dilemma over what 
role UP itself is supposed to play here.  61   If 
Hume is saying that UP functions as an inter -
mediate step in inductive inference,  then it 
looks as though he thinks inductive inference 
 does  involve stepwise ratiocination ( via  UP 
itself),  in which case he is contradicting the 
very conclusion that Owen takes him to be 
drawing from the argument.  If, on the other 
hand,  Hume is denying that UP can play any 
psychological role within inductive inference 
(on the basis that it has no ‘just foundation’),  
then it is unclear why he should take this to 
imply anything further about the actual psy-
chological mechanism of inductive inference.  
The only apparently plausible answer here is to 
see Hume as placing a conditional constraint 
on how stepwise ‘reason’  could   work: ‘ If  rea-
son determin’d us,  it w ou’d proceed upon’ 
UP (THN 1.3.6.4 / 89; emphasis added).  But 
this conditional statement appears  only  in the 
 Treatise  presentation,  and even there,  it is fol-
lowed three paragraphs later by the uncondi-
tional statement that ‘probability  is  founded 
on the presumption of ’ UP (THN 1.3.6.7 / 
90; emphasis added).  62   Owen largely builds 
his interpretation around the conditional,  63   
but it is straining credibility to rely so heav-
ily on one statement in the  Treatise , when we 
have seen so much evidence in sections 2.1–3 
above that the versions in the  Abstr act  and 
(especially) the  Enquiry  are more carefully 
crafted.  
 On a psychological interpretation,  more-
over, Hume should not be so confident that 
mediated ratiocination for a factual conclu-
sion can proceed only via UP .  64   At best,  he 
can claim that any  rationall y sufficient  rea-
soning for such a conclusion must involve 
UP. And likewise,  his argument seems com-
pletely inadequate to show that UP itself 
could not be believed on the basis of some 
mediated ratiocination.  At best,  again,  he has shown that UP has no ‘just’ foundation 
in demonstrative or factual reasoning.  65   But 
why should this be thought to exhaust the 
possibilities  of relevant reasoning? Hume 
quite often refers to ‘arguments’ or ‘rea-
soning’ that he considers ‘absurd’,  ‘falla-
cious’,  or ‘sophistical’ (e.g.  THN 1.2.4.11 / 
43, 1.4.5.30 / 247; DNR 9.189–92); on a 
 psychological  interpretation of the famous 
argument,  these should be as relevant to his 
theory as the ‘just’ reasonings that he is able 
to rule out.  66   Suppose,  for example,  it were 
suggested that induction can be founded on 
the principle that every change must have a 
cause,  and hence the  ultimate  causal laws 
must be consistent over time.  This would 
bring into play the attempted demonstra-
tions of the Causal Maxim that Hume 
refutes at THN 1.3.3.4–8 / 80–2: even if 
fallacious,  they could still be contenders as 
 psychological  explanations of our induct-
ive assumptions.  In short,  Hume has done 
nothing to refute the hypothesis that UP 
may be believed on the basis of an  invalid  
demonstrative argument; hence on the inter -
pretations of Owen and Garrett,  his famous 
argument is hopelessly incomplete.  67   
 But things are even worse than this,  for yet 
another strategy that remains open on their 
readings was actually used by Hume’ s friend 
and correspondent Richard Price in the 
first chapter of his  Review of the Principal 
Questions in Mor als . Price claims that the 
Causal Maxim is known intuitively , ‘nothing 
being more clearly absurd and contradict-
ory, than the notion of a change without a 
 changer ’.  68   Then,  in a footnote a few pages 
later, he explains how this can provide a 
basis for inferring future events from past 
regularity:
  The conviction produced by experience  
is built on the same principle,  with that  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   769780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   76 4/17/2012   3:58:33 PM4/17/2012   3:58:33 PM77HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
which assures us,  that there must be a  
cause of every event .  . . Because we see  
intuitively , that there being some reason  
or cause of this  constanc y of ev ent , it must  
be derived from causes regularly and con-
stantly operating .  . . And the more fre-
quently and uninterruptedly we knew this  
had happened,  the stronger would be our  
expectation of its happening again,  . . .   69     
 Hume produced no fewer than seven editions 
of his  Enquiry  after Price published this,  and 
it would be astonishing if he did not know 
of it, given that the  Enquiry  itself – under its 
original title  Philosophical Essa ys  – is men-
tioned twice within the vicinity of these quo-
tations (in footnotes on pages 12 and 41).  As 
interpreted by Owen and Garrett,  however , 
Hume’ s famous argument completely fails to 
engage with Price’ s justification of induction.  
That justification starts from what Hume 
would no doubt claim to be a fallacious ‘intu-
ition’,  but again there is no obvious  psycho-
logical     obstacle to erecting an argument on a 
fallacy: humans do it all the time! 
 Another related issue concerns the intended 
scope of the famous argument: is it supposed 
to be proving something about  every indi-
vidual  factual inference,  or about the genesis 
of our  gener al practice  of factual inference? 
When developing his interpretation,  Owen 
writes repeatedly as though it were the latter , 
for example:
  If the uniformity principle were some-
thing we knew or believed,  prior to our 
engaging in probable reasoning,  70   we 
could explain probable reasoning as 
being based on reason.  . . . [P]rior to our 
engaging in probable reasoning,  we .  . . 
neither know nor believe the uniform-
ity principle.  . . . Hume’ s argument .  . . 
has more to do with the failure of reason 
to account for why we have the beliefs we do than with why those beliefs are 
unjustified.  71     
 But when articulating Hume’ s conclusion,  
Owen apparently moves towards a claim 
about the functioning of all individual 
inductive inferences,  and strongly contrasts 
this with the alternative view as ascribed to 
Garrett:
  Hume is here denying that such infer -
ences can be explained as an activity of 
the faculty of reason conceived as func-
tioning by the discovery of intermedi-
ate ideas .  . . Garrett says that Hume ‘is 
denying only that we come to engage 
in this species of reasoning as a result 
of any piece of reasoning  about  it’.  72  . . . 
My main objection to Garrett’ s inter -
pretation is that he treats Hume as ask-
ing about the cause of our engaging in 
probable reasoning .  . . Hume’ s question 
is not what Garrett takes it to be.  Hume’ s 
question is: how is it that we manage to 
make these inferences?  73     
 As we have seen already , however , Garrett’ s 
interpretation in his 1997 book was  
quickly modified (in his 1998 debate with  
me), at which point he clarified that,  like 
Owen,  he took Hume’ s conclusion to be  
one that applies to all individual inductive  
inferences:
  [From] Cognition and Commitment . . . , 
Millican understandably infers that on my  
interpretation ‘it is only the  gener al practice   
of induction that fails to be determined by  
reason,  and each of our  particular  inductive  
inferences is itself an instance of the oper -
ation of our reason. ’ . . . The crucial dis-
tinction for Hume,  however , is . . . between  
an inference being an  instance  of reason-
ing and the same inference being  caused     by  
(another instance of) reasoning.  74     
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   779780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   77 4/17/2012   3:58:33 PM4/17/2012   3:58:33 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
78 The significance of this point is that the 
bulk of Hume’ s argument,  and especially 
his conclusion – in both the  Treatise  and 
the  Enquiry  – seems to intend a result about 
 every particular f actual inference   (cf. sec-
tion 2.4 [H] above).  But on the interpret-
ations of Owen and Garrett,  the argument 
seems to lead far more plausibly to a result 
about  factual inference in gener al . Note,  for 
example,  that Hume takes many induct-
ive inferences to be reflective and mediated,  
especially those that involve ‘inferences from 
contrary phænomena’ (THN 1.3.12.7 / 133) 
or the application and balancing of ‘general 
rules’ (THN 1.3.13.7–12 / 146–50,  1.3.15 / 
173–5).  Moreover , inductive inferences from 
‘only one experiment of a particular effect’ 
can – Hume says – be mediated by explicit 
reflection on a principle which looks very 
similar to UP (THN 1.3.8.14 / 104–5).  75   
Owen is well aware of this,  76   but he does 
not apparently recognize the threat to his 
own interpretation,  under which such medi-
ated inferences become counterexamples to 
Hume’ s conclusion,  at least if that is read 
(as Hume’ s own words seem to require) as a 
claim about each and every factual inference.  
 Garrett is also aware that ‘not all probable 
inferences are immediate’,  but he endeavours 
to explain how nevertheless Hume’ s conclu-
sion can be seen to apply even to those that 
are mediated:
  it may well happen,  as Millican notes,  
that one piece of probable reasoning is 
part of another piece of probable rea-
soning .  . . But as Hume states his con-
clusion .  . . , it is that ‘in all reasonings 
from experience,  there is  a  step taken by 
the mind which is not supported by any 
argument or process of the understand-
ing’ [EHU 5.2 / 41; emphasis added].  
Where a piece of probable reasoning 
does occur as part of a second piece of probable reasoning,  it will involve 
a crucial step that is not supported by 
any argument .  . . ; that is the point of 
Hume’ s discovery . Reasoning cannot 
cause the crossing of an inductive gap.  77     
 However , my objection to which this was a 
response referred not to the situation where 
‘one piece of probable reasoning is  part  of 
another piece of probable reasoning’,  but 
rather , where one inductive inference’ s  con-
clusion  (e.g.  ‘a general principle of uniform-
ity’ as at THN 1.3.8.14 / 104–5) is then given 
‘the role of a  premise  in further inductive 
inference’.  78   Garrett’ s response thus preserves 
what he takes to be Hume’ s conclusion,  as 
universally applicable to factual inferences,  
only by stipulatively treating  the inference 
which was used to establish a proposition   
as itself a part of  the further inference whic h 
then tak es that proposition as a premise . In 
the context of discussing the  epistemolog y  
of induction,  this might seem reasonable 
enough: if the proposition in question has a 
problematic foundation,  then those problems 
will be inherited by any further inference 
built on it.  But if Hume’ s famous argument 
is to be interpreted as involving the  psycho-
logical mec hanism of indi vidual inducti ve 
inferences  – as Garrett intends – then the 
move looks artificial and  ad hoc , smudging 
over the manifest difference between  argu-
ing  for some proposition and  taking it as 
assumed or established  (on the basis of pre-
vious argument).  
 To sum up so far , we have yet to find an  
interpretation that is genuinely satisfying.  Any 
extreme sceptical reading leaves Hume’ s phil-
osophy hopelessly inconsistent.  The  anti-de-
ducti vist  reading and that of Owen both have  
serious difficulty making sense of the logic of  
his argument,  and also have to rely on the text-
ually questionable claim that Hume’ s notion of  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   789780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   78 4/17/2012   3:58:33 PM4/17/2012   3:58:33 PM79HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
‘reason’ within the argument is a target rather  
than sincere (a problem which also beset my  
own previous interpretation).  79   Garrett’ s read-
ing has the significant merit of avoiding this  
last pitfall,  but again has difficulty squaring  
with the argument’ s text and logic,  and has  
been forced to adapt accordingly over time.  
Initially , Garrett understood Hume’ s conclu-
sion as the straightforward claim that ‘we do  
not adopt induction on the basis of recogniz-
ing an  argument  for its reliability’.  80   This soon 
changed into the more complex claim that ‘the 
underlying causal mechanism that gives rise to  
inductive inferences .  . . is not itself dependent  
on any reasoning or inference’.  81   Meanwhile,  
since the  Enquiry  argument clearly ranges  
beyond narrow ‘reasoning or inference’,  
Garrett suggested that here Hume ‘expands  
the famous conclusion to rule out any “rea-
soning  or process of the under standing ,” 
thereby eliminating such non-inferential proc-
esses of the understanding as intuition or the  
perception of a probable connection between  
even a single “proof”  and a conclusion’.  82   But 
pushing in the opposite direction,  his recog-
nition that Hume acknowledges the role of  
explicit (and sometimes complex) ratiocin-
ation within some inductive inferences has led  
to a narrowing of the supposed conclusion,  to 
focus on the very specific logical step which is  
‘the crossing of an inductive gap’.  83   Even after  
all this,  as we have seen,  Garrett’ s defence of  
the interpretation looks suspiciously  ad hoc , 
holding that conclusion to be true even of an  
inductive inference which  explicitl y  argues  
across the inductive gap using an anteced-
ently established Uniformity Principle,  sim-
ply on the basis that some  previous  inference  
was required to establish that principle.  But 
by now the interpretation has been diluted  
beyond recognition,  and we seem to have lost  
any focus on the actual psychological mech-
anism of individual inductive inferences – this  is looking far more like a discussion of the  
epistemology of our general presumption of  
uniformity .  
  3.2 ‘R EASON ’ AS THE COGNITI VE FACULTY  
 One promising route towards a better under -
standing of Humean ‘reason’ is to look at the 
usage of Hume’ s contemporaries in Scotland 
and England,  and especially those who – 
unlike Locke – were enthusiastic about the 
language of ‘faculties’ and relatively con-
sistent in their usage.  84   Francis Hutcheson,  
Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow 
and correspondent with Hume from 1739,  
provides the closest spatio-temporal match 
to the Treatise,  having published in 1742 no 
fewer than four works containing an out-
line of the faculties,  at least one of which – 
 Philosophiae Mor alis Institutio Compendiaria   
(later translated as  A Short Introduction to 
Moral Philosoph y ) – he sent to Hume.  85   This,  
like the  Synopsis Metaph ysicae  ( Synopsis of 
Metaph ysics )  86   was a Latin teaching text,  and 
contains a discussion of ‘The parts or pow-
ers of the soul’.  87   The other two works were 
 An Essa y on the Nature and Conduct of the 
Affections  and  Illustr ations on the Mor al 
Sense , published together as a third edition 
of both.  To the former , Hutheson added a 
footnote on the faculties,  88   and to the latter , 
a new paragraph:
  Writers on these Subjects should 
remember the common Divisions of 
the Faculties of the Soul.  That there is 
1.  Reason  presenting the natures and 
relations of things,  antecedently to any 
Act of  Will  or  Desire : 2. The  Will , . . . 
or the disposition of Soul to pursue 
what is presented as good,  and to shun 
Evil. . . . Both these Powers are by the 
Antients included under the Λόγος or 
λογικò ν μέρος.  Below these they place 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   799780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   79 4/17/2012   3:58:33 PM4/17/2012   3:58:33 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
80two other powers dependent on the 
Body , the  Sensus , and the  Appetitus 
Sensiti vus , in which they place the par -
ticular Passions: the former answers to 
the  Under standing , and the latter to 
the  Will . But the Will is forgot of late,  
and some ascribe to the  Intellect , not 
only  Contemplation  or Knowledge,  but 
 Choice ,  Desire ,  Prosecuting ,  Loving .  89     
 It is clear from his alternation between 
‘ Reason ’ and ‘the  Under standing ’ that 
Hutcheson takes these to be one and the 
same; indeed his  Essay ’s new footnote says as 
much.  90   This equivalence is also asserted (or 
manifested through the same sort of elegant 
variation of terminology that we see above) 
by various other writers known to Hume,  for 
example Shaftesbury , Butler and Price,  91   so it 
was evidently commonplace,  though writers 
in the Scottish common-sense school later 
preferred to use ‘reason’ more narrowly , in 
much the way that Garrett favours.  92   Hume 
himself,  however , is clearly aligned with 
the former group,  interchanging between 
‘reason’ and ‘the understanding’ dozens of 
times – purely for the sake of stylistic vari-
ation – just as he does between ‘the fancy’ 
and ‘the imagination’:  93   
 the mind .  . . is not determin’d by  reason , 
but by certain principles,  which associate 
together the ideas of these objects,  and 
unite them in  the imagination  . Had ideas 
no more union in  the fancy  than objects 
seem to have to  the under standing , . . . 
(THN 1.3.6.12 / 92; emphasis added) 
 There are no principles either of  the 
under standing  or  fancy , which lead 
us directly to embrace this opinion .  . . 
The .  . . hypothesis has no primary rec-
ommendation either to  reason  or  the 
imagination  . . . (THN 1.4.2.46 / 211; 
my emphasis)  This sceptical doubt,  both with respect 
to  reason and the senses  . . . ’Tis impos-
sible upon any system to defend either 
 our under standing or senses  . . . ’ (THN 
1.4.2.57 / 218; emphasis added)   
 Consider also the following two footnotes,  
the first of which was expanded and moved 
to create the second: 
 when it [the imagination] is oppos’d 
to  the under standing , I understand the 
same faculty , excluding only our demon-
strative and probable reasonings.  (THN 
2.2.7.6n / 371n; emphasis added) 
 when I oppose it [the imagination] to 
 reason , I mean the same faculty , exclud-
ing only our demonstrative and prob-
able reasonings.  (THN 1.3.9.19n22 / 
117–18n; emphasis added)   
 Again,  the switch from ‘the understanding’ 
to ‘reason’ looks purely stylistic,  perhaps 
prompted by the clumsiness of ‘. . . the under -
standing,  I understand .  . . ’. 
 There is thus overwhelming textual evi-
dence that Hume generally treats ‘reason’ 
and ‘the understanding’ as one and the 
same.  And virtually all major writers of the 
period take ‘the understanding’ to refer to 
our principal cognitive faculty , usually draw-
ing a general division between it and ‘the 
will’.  94   This division between the domains 
of  the under standing   and  the will  is indeed 
essentially the same as the modern distinc-
tion between  cogniti ve  and  conati ve  mental 
functions,  a dichotomy whose fundamental 
nature is often now expressed in terms of a 
‘direction of fit’ between world and mind: 
 the under standing  aims to conform our 
beliefs to the way the world is,  while  the will  
aims to change the world to conform to our 
desires.  Reid characterizes this in terms of a 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   809780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   80 4/17/2012   3:58:34 PM4/17/2012   3:58:34 PM81HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
distinction between our  intellectual  (or  con-
templati ve ) and  active  powers:
  We shall .  . . take that general division 
which is the most common,  into the pow-
ers of  under standing  and those of  will . 
Under the will we comprehend our active 
powers,  and all that lead to action,  or 
influence the mind to act; such as,  appe-
tites, passions,  affections.  The under -
standing comprehends our contemplative 
powers; by which we perceive objects; by 
which we conceive or remember them; 
by which we analyse or compound them; 
and by which we judge and reason con-
cerning them.  . . . The intellectual powers 
are commonly divided into simple appre-
hension,  judgment,  and reasoning.  95     
 Although Reid is somewhat critical of this 
framework,  which he takes to be ‘of a very 
general reception’,  his clear account of it is 
helpful in setting the scene for Hume,  whose 
understanding of it – though again critical – 
seems to be very similar .  96   
 The earlier quotation from Hutcheson’ s 
 Illustr ations on the Mor al Sense  likewise  
recognizes this ‘common Division of the  
Faculties of the Soul’ between ‘ Reason ’ (or ‘the 
 Under standing ’) and ‘The  Will ’, while suggest-
ing a hierarchical structure in which the senses  
‘answer to’ the understanding,  and the passions  
to the will.  His  Short Introduction to Mor al 
Philosoph y , however , paints a cruder picture  
which is closer to that outlined by Reid above:
  The parts or powers of the soul .  . . are all  
reducible to two classes,  the  Under standing   
and the  Will . The former contains all the  
powers which aim at knowledge; the  
other all our desires.  . . . [Of] the several  
operations of the understanding .  . . The 
first in order are the  senses  . . . Senses are  
either  external , or  internal .  97      This treats the senses themselves as ‘oper -
ations of the understanding’,  a tendency  
common enough for Price to make a point  
of criticizing it.  98   But Hutcheson’ s  Synopsis  
of Metaph ysics , within two sentences,  first  
implicitly places the senses within the under -
standing and then gives them a subordinate  
reporting role,  which suggests that the former  
placement is just a shorthand way of indicat-
ing that the senses fall within the understand-
ing’s sphere of influence:  
we might reasonably reduce [the powers 
of the mind] to two,  namely , the faculty 
of  under standing  and the faculty of  will-
ing , which are concerned respectively 
with knowing things and with render -
ing life happy . The  senses  report to the 
 under standing , . . .   99   
The  Synopsis  goes on to give Hutcheson’ s 
most detailed account of his faculty frame-
work,  with  Chapter 1  of Part II devoted to a  
categorization of the powers associated with  
the understanding,  including  external sensa-
tion  (sect.  3),  internal senses or consciousness   
(sect.  4),  reflexi ve or subsequent sensations   
(sect.  5),  memory , the pow er of reasoning  and 
 imagination  (sect.  6).  100   This again suggests a  
hierarchical structure,  with these various pow-
ers ‘reporting to’ an overseer faculty – reason  
or the understanding  proper – which perceives  
and judges the deliverances of the subordin-
ate faculties in order to establish truth.  Thus  
‘Reason is understood  to denote our  Power of 
finding out true Propositions ’.  101   Price talks  
in a similar spirit of ‘the power within us that  
 under stands ; . . . the faculty .  . . that discerns  
 truth , that views,  compares,  and  judges  of all  
ideas and things’.  102   And a similar conceptual  
linkage between  reason  or  the under standing   
and the search for  truth  is common to many  
other writers.  103   
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   819780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   81 4/17/2012   3:58:34 PM4/17/2012   3:58:34 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
82 We are now in a position to appreciate the 
significance of Hume’ s repeated statements 
that align him strongly with this general con-
ception of  reason  as  cognition :  104   
 Reason is the discovery of truth or fal-
shood.  (THN 3.1.1.9 / 458); 
 That faculty , by which we discern 
Truth and Falshood,  . . . (EHU 1.4n – 
1748/1750 editions);  105   
 Thus the distinct boundaries and offices 
of reason and of taste are easily ascer -
tained.  The former conveys the knowl-
edge of truth and falsehood: .  . . (EPM 
App. 1.21 / 294); 
 reason,  in a strict sense,  as meaning the 
judgment of truth and falsehood,  . . . 
(DIS 5.1 / 24; cf.  THN 2.3.3.8 / 417).    
 In all these contexts,  Hume is stressing that 
reason,  since it is purely  cogniti ve , cannot 
also be  conati ve : that is,  it cannot be contrary 
to any passion or – by itself – provide any 
motive to action or the will.  This is the crux 
of one of Hume’ s three most famous argu-
ments concerning the incapacity of reason,  
which concludes that ‘Since morals .  . . have 
an influence on the actions and affections,  it 
follows,  that they cannot be deriv’d from rea-
son’ (THN 3.1.1.6 / 457).  For the purpose of 
this argument,  it is enough that  reason  is con-
fined to the domain of truth and falsehood,  
though Hume’ s talk of  discov ery ,  discern-
ment  and  knowledge  suggests a normative 
bias towards truth rather than falsehood.  
This normative flavour is far more explicit 
in another of the three famous arguments,  
this time concerning the external world (the 
third,  of course,  concerns induction): 
 The vulgar confound perceptions and 
objects .  . . This sentiment,  then,  as it is entirely unreasonable,  must proceed 
from some other faculty than the under -
standing.  . . . Even after we distinguish 
our perceptions from our objects,  ’twill 
appear presently , that we are still incap-
able of reasoning from the existence of 
one to that of the other: So that upon 
the whole our reason neither does,  nor is 
it possible it ever shou’d,  . . . give us an 
assurance of the continu’d and distinct 
existence of body . (THN 1.4.2.14 / 193) 
 ’tis a false opinion that any of our .  . . 
perceptions,  are identically the same 
after an interruption; and consequently 
. . . can never arise from reason,  . . . 
(THN 1.4.2.43 / 209) 
 we may observe a conjunction or a rela-
tion of cause and effect betwixt differ -
ent perceptions,  but can never observe 
it betwixt perceptions and objects.  ’Tis 
impossible,  therefore,  that from the exist-
ence or any of the qualities of the former , 
we can ever form any conclusion con-
cerning the existence of the latter ,  106   or 
ever satisfy our reason in this  particular . 
(THN 1.4.2.47 / 212)   
 It might appear strange that in one of these 
arguments,   reason   seems to embrace both 
truth and falsehood,  whereas in the other , it 
is normatively connected with  truth . But this 
sort of linguistic variation is commonplace,  
and it is worth noting that an unambiguous 
identification of  reason  with  the cogniti ve 
faculty  is consistent with a fairly wide range 
of nuances of meaning.  Given such an iden-
tification,  ‘reason’ might most naturally be 
used to refer to the human (or animal) fac-
ulty of truth-apprehension,   however w ell 
and b y whatev er processes it oper ates  (as, 
for example,  when Hume compares the ‘rea-
son’ of people and animals at THN 3.3.4.5 / 
610).  But sometimes there might be debate 
over these processes,  in which case we could 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   829780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   82 4/17/2012   3:58:34 PM4/17/2012   3:58:34 PM83HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
find ourselves referring to  processes that are 
commonl y tak en to be inv olved in truth-
apprehension , even if they turn out not to 
be truth-conducive (as suggested by Hume’ s 
‘scepticism with regard to reason’ of  Treatise   
1.4.1).  Alternatively , we might wish to apply 
a stricter criterion under which ‘reason’ 
would be confined to processes that  operate 
successfull y to apprehend truth  (thus giving 
the normative flavour of the passages from 
 Treatise  1.4.2 quoted above).  107   A differ -
ent strict usage is to refer to  the faculty of 
truth-apprehension acting entirel y alone , 
independently of other faculties such as the 
senses or memory (this seems to be Hume’ s 
intention at THN 3.1.2.1 / 470).  108   Finally , 
there is in the early modern period a com-
mon metonymy , under which ‘reason’ is used 
to refer to its  product , namely true belief as 
successfully achieved using our rational fac-
ulty (hence the pairing of ‘truth and reason’ 
at THN 2.3.3.5 / 415,  3.1.1.15 / 461,  and 
THN App.  1 / 623; cf.  also note 84 above).  
Notice that acknowledgement of all these 
nuances is quite different from supposing an 
 ambiguity  in ‘reason’,  because they all arise 
naturally from the core meaning,  and there 
need be no suggestion that the word has been 
coincidentally assigned two or more distinct 
meanings.  With this understood,  much of the 
evidence that has previously been adduced 
for the ambiguity of ‘reason’ is significantly 
undermined,  and it becomes more plausible 
to suggest that the term has,  for Hume,  a sin-
gle core meaning,  namely what we now call 
 cognition .  
  3.3 R EASON  AND THE IMAGINATION  
 If  reason , for Hume,  is just our overall cogni-
tive faculty , and if his general epistemological 
approach is – as set out in Section 1 above – 
to begin by ascribing default authority to our natural faculties,  then one would expect 
that his arguments about reason’ s capabili-
ties would start from a relatively straightfor -
ward and conventional understanding of our 
cognitive functions.  Coming from a Lockean 
background,  it is no surprise to find Hume 
recognizing the cognitive faculties of  the 
senses ,  memory ,  intuition , and  demonstr ative  
and  probable reasoning .  109   The  senses  can 
be either  external  (i.e.  sight ,  touch ,  hearing , 
 smell , gustatory  taste ) or  internal  (i.e.  reflec-
tion ) – these provide the  impressions  from 
which our  ideas  are copied,  and those ideas 
are represented to us either through  the mem-
ory  or  the imagination . It follows that all of 
our thinking,  except in so far as it confines 
itself to memory , must involve representation 
of ideas in the imagination,  which is appar -
ently to be thought of as something like a 
multi-layered or multi-dimensional canvas 
on which sense-copied ideas appear , with dif-
ferent degrees of ‘force and vivacity’ and ‘in a 
perpetual flux and movement’  (THN 1.4.6.4 
/ 252).  110   Thus our faculties of  intuition ,  dem-
onstr ation , and  probable reasoning  must 
inevitably act on our imagination,  through 
such processes as bringing ideas into mind,  
dismissing others,  or – most importantly 
given Hume’ s analysis of belief (summarized 
at the end of section 2.1 above) – changing 
their degrees of force and vivacity . Even when 
we make judgements about the deliverances 
of our  senses   and  memory , it is their force 
and vivacity in the imagination which appar -
ently constitutes our assent to them.  111   Hence 
Hume’ s comment,  leading into the sceptical 
anxieties of the Conclusion of  Treatise   Book 
1, that: ‘The memory , senses,  and understand-
ing are,  therefore,  all of them founded on the 
imagination,  or the vivacity of ideas’ (THN 
1.4.7.3 / 265).  This comment might be read as 
suggesting that the imagination is itself active,  
but earlier in the same paragraph,  Hume 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   839780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   83 4/17/2012   3:58:35 PM4/17/2012   3:58:35 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
84makes clear that he is talking of  principles   
(namely  experience  and  habit ) that ‘operate 
upon the imagination’.  The initial framing of 
his discussion of induction in the  Treatise   (as 
quoted earlier in section 2.1) may give a differ -
ent impression: ‘the next question is,  Whether 
experience produces the idea by means of the 
understanding or imagination; whether we 
are determin’d by reason to make the tran-
sition,  or by a certain association and rela-
tion of perceptions?’ (THN 1.3.6.4 / 88–9).  
But Hume’ s answer to his own question – 
repeated numerous times – will be that our 
causal reasoning is  determined b y custom ,  112   
and he never says that it is  determined b y the 
imagination  itself.  So at least in this context,  
the imagination is apparently only the virtual 
stage on which the mind’ s various principles – 
either of reason or custom – orchestrate their 
dance of perceptions.  113   
 In other contexts,  however , the imagination 
does appear as an active agent,  having  the lib-
erty to tr anspose and c hange its ideas   (THN 
1.1.3.4 / 10,  1.1.4.1 / 10–11,  1.3.5.3 / 85,  
1.3.7.7 / 97; EHU 2.4 / 18,  5.10 / 47–8,  5.12 
/ 49),  to  distinguish  and  separ ate them  (THN 
1.2.4.3 / 40,  1.2.5.3 / 54–5,  1.3.3.3 / 79–80,  
1.4.5.5 / 233),  to  suggest  (THN 1.1.7.15 / 
23–4) or  raise them up  (THN 1.2.1.3 / 27),  
and to generate  fictions  (THN 1.1.6.2 / 16,  
1.4.2.29 / 200–1,  1.4.2.36 / 205,  1.4.2.43 
/ 209,  1.4.2.52 / 215,  1.4.3.3–5 / 220–1,  
1.4.3.11 / 224–5,  1.4.6.6–7 / 253–5).  114   The 
distinction between the two classes of oper -
ation seems to be explained by the footnote at 
THN 1.3.9.19 / 117 which we encountered in 
section 3.2 above:
  In general we may observe,  that as 
our assent to all probable reasonings 
is founded on the vivacity of ideas,  it 
resembles many of those whimsies and 
prejudices,  which are rejected under the opprobrious character of being the 
offspring of the imagination.  By this 
expression it appears that the word,  
 imagination , is commonly us’d in two 
different senses; and tho’ nothing be 
more contrary to true philosophy , than 
this inaccuracy , yet in the following rea-
sonings I have often been oblig’d to fall 
into it.  When I oppose the imagination to 
the memory , I mean the faculty , by which 
we form our fainter ideas.  When I oppose 
it to reason,  115   I mean the same faculty , 
excluding only our demonstrative and 
probable reasonings.  (THN 1.3.9.19n22 
/ 117–18n)   
 This note was inserted by means of a ‘cancel’ 
leaf, prepared by Hume while the  Treatise  
was going through the press,  and I believe 
he saw the need for this on rereading the end 
of THN 1.3.9.4 / 108:  116   ‘All this,  and every 
thing else,  which I believe,  are nothing but 
ideas; tho’ by their force and settled order , 
arising from custom and the relation of 
cause and effect,  they distinguish themselves 
from the other ideas,  which are merely the 
offspring of the imagination’.  A related pas-
sage is at THN 1.4.4.1 / 225,  where Hume 
addresses the complaint that he has criticized 
‘the antient philosophers’ for being guided by 
imaginative fancies,  whilst building his own 
philosophy on principles of the imagination:
  In order to justify myself,  I must dis-
tinguish in the imagination betwixt the 
principles which are permanent,  irresist-
ible, and universal; such as the custom-
ary transition from causes to effects,  and 
from effects to causes: And the principles,  
which are changeable,  weak,  and irregu-
lar; such as those I have just now taken 
notice of [e.g.  the ‘inclination in human 
nature to bestow on external objects 
the same emotions,  which it observes 
in itself ’, as attributed to the ‘antient 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   849780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   84 4/17/2012   3:58:35 PM4/17/2012   3:58:35 PM85HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
philosophers’].  The former are the foun-
dation of all our thoughts and actions,  so 
that upon their removal human nature 
must immediately perish and go to ruin.  
The latter are neither unavoidable to 
mankind,  nor necessary , or so much as 
useful in the conduct of life .  . .   
 All three passages point to a distinction 
drawn within the class of principles that 
‘operate on the imagination’ – that is,  which 
affect our thinking.  Some of these are ‘the 
foundation of all our thoughts and actions’,  
the ‘permanent,  irresistible,  and universal’ 
principles that ground ‘our demonstrative 
and probable reasonings’,  and are therefore 
appropriately dignified with the name of  rea-
son  or  the under standing . The other princi-
ples are those that we more naturally think of 
as belonging to the  imagination  itself: those 
that ground our free play of ideas,  fictions,  
whimsies and prejudices.  Hence in this nar -
rower sense  the imagination  is in opposition 
to  reason , though both sets of principles per -
form on the same stage –  the imagination  in 
the broader sense – where all our non-mem-
ory ideas are represented.  It is this broader 
sense which enables Hume to refer , without 
paradox,  to ‘the understanding,  that is,  . . . 
the general and more establish’d properties 
of the imagination’ (THN 1.4.7.7 / 267).  117    
  3.4 A N OPER ATION  OF REASON  WHIC H IS 
‘NOT DETERMIN ’D BY REASON ’ 
 Equipped with this understanding of the 
Humean faculties,  let us now try to clarify 
the significance of his famous argument.  In 
the  Treatise  , he considers a paradigm causal 
inference ‘from the impression to the idea’; 
in the  Abstr act  and  Enquiry , he widens this 
to any factual inference ‘beyond the present 
testimony of our senses,  or the records of our memory’ (EHU 4.3 / 26).  He then iden-
tifies the crucial step of such inference: the 
extrapolation from observed to unobserved 
which is encapsulated in his Uniformity 
Principle.  If this is to qualify as founded on 
 reason , then there must be some cognitive 
operation that grounds it,  and which does 
so through genuine  cognition  (rather than 
some fallacy or confusion).  In the  Treatise   
and  Abstr act , Hume apparently takes it to be 
obvious that the only plausible contenders 
here are  demonstr ative reasoning   and  prob-
able  (i.e.  moral  or  factual )  reasoning . In the 
 Enquiry  he is more thorough,  and rules out 
also both  intuition  and  sensory knowledge   
as sources of foundation for the Uniformity 
Principle.  Since  memory   is taken for granted 
in the experiential observations from which 
the inference starts,  this exhausts all the 
standardly recognized sources of evidence 
with which reason might operate.  It is there-
fore no coincidence that the four sources 
considered – and rejected – in Hume’ s argu-
ment in the 1748  Enquiry  match up exactly 
with those itemized in his 1745  Letter from 
a Gentleman : ‘It is common for Philosophers 
to distinguish the Kinds of Evidence into 
 intuiti ve ,  demonstr ative ,  sensible ,  and mor al ; 
. . .’ (LFG 22).  If  reason  is understood by 
Hume in the standard contemporary way – 
as the overall cognitive faculty – then we 
should indeed expect it to embrace all four 
‘Kinds of Evidence’.  
 Notice that this way of reading Hume’ s 
argument has the clear implication that 
inductive (i.e.  probable,  moral,  factual) 
inference is being treated as an operation of 
reason throughout,  which at least strongly 
suggests that it would be a mistake to inter -
pret Hume’ s conclusion – that such inference 
is ‘not determin’d by reason’ – as deposing 
it from that status.  (For if that were indeed 
his intention,  one might reasonably expect 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   859780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   85 4/17/2012   3:58:35 PM4/17/2012   3:58:35 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
86such an apparently paradoxical move to 
be far more clearly signalled.) So we need 
to understand how Hume,  as a result of 
his famous argument,  can coherently view 
induction as  an oper ation of reason whic h is 
not ‘determin’ d by’ reason .  118   
 The obvious answer , given both our inter -
pretation of reason and the structure of 
Hume’ s argument,  is that he views induction 
 as a cogniti ve process whic h depends on a 
non-cogniti ve sub-process  . So he is think-
ing at two levels,  with inductive inference 
being a manifest operation of our conscious 
reason,  causally driven by a subconscious 
process that involves the customary enliven-
ment of our ideas.  This underlying process 
is of a type which is naturally categorized as 
‘imaginative’ rather than ‘rational’,  because 
it works through an associative mechanism 
which automatically and mindlessly extrapo-
lates beyond anything that we have perceived 
or otherwise detected in the world (whether 
objective events,  or evidence).  It is therefore 
in sharp contrast with the underlying pro-
cess hypothesized by Locke,  who supposed 
inductive (i.e.  probable) inference to be 
driven by a  perceptual  process,  namely the 
rational apprehension of objective probable 
connexions.  Locke therefore saw induction 
as  a cogniti ve process whic h depends on a 
cogniti ve sub-process  – apparently ‘cognitive 
all the way down’ because it is ultimately 
founded on direct perception of evidential 
connexions.  Hume’ s argument destroys this 
illusion by showing that there is no plausible 
source for such perception: it cannot derive 
from examining relations of ideas (because it 
depends on the experienced world),  but nor 
can it derive from experience,  either current 
(because the senses detect no such evidential 
connexions) or remembered (because induct-
ive extrapolation is the very process whose 
perceptual basis we are seeking).   A similar theme can be seen in the other of 
Hume’ s most famous arguments that assigns 
a vital role to the imagination,  on ‘Scepticism 
with Regard to the Senses’ (THN 1.4.2 / 
187–218).  Here he takes on the natural and 
naive assumption that external objects – dis-
tinct from us and continuous over time – are 
directly and straightforwardly  perceived 
through the senses.  To refute this,  he shows 
that identification  of objects over time 
requires a process that goes beyond anything 
we perceive,  latching onto patterns of ‘con-
stancy’ and ‘coherence’ in our distinct impres-
sions,  and smoothing over gaps and changes 
to generate an illusion of continuity . Again 
the process involved is naturally categorized 
as ‘imaginative’,  and so Hume describes 
his argument as showing that our ‘assur -
ance of the continued and distinct existence 
of body .  . . must be entirely owing to the 
 imagina tion ’ (THN 1.4.2.14 / 193).  Like 
his argument concerning induction,  there-
fore, this can be seen as making a significant 
contribution to  both  cognitive science  and  
epistemology , by highlighting how the infor -
mational processes that are implicit in the 
temporal identification of physical objects 
go well beyond anything that is directly per -
ceived.  Indeed modern-day cognitive science,  
through the development of ‘artificial  intel-
ligence’ visual systems,  has provided striking 
vindication of Hume,  by showing how even 
the identification of physical objects  at a time  
requires ‘imagination-like’  processes of edge-
detection,  region identification,  shadow and 
texture interpretation,  and so forth.  So far 
from being merely passive,  visual perception 
involves many active – albeit unconscious – 
processes,  without which the manifold of our 
sensory impressions would be completely 
incomprehensible.  
 This interpretation of Hume involves 
understanding his talk of faculties as 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   869780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   86 4/17/2012   3:58:36 PM4/17/2012   3:58:36 PM87HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
descriptive of  types of process   rather than as 
references to parts of the mind,  and indeed 
this seems anyway to be required in the light 
of his general scepticism about any faculty 
language that pretends to be more than a 
functional description (THN 1.4.3.10 / 224; 
DNR 4.162–3).  For Hume,  as for Locke,  a 
faculty just names a power .  119   Nevertheless,  
at least in the  Treatise , he has an unfortunate 
tendency to talk of faculties in the way that 
Locke rightly deplored,  as ‘so many distinct 
Agents’.  120   Taking such language literally , his 
famous argument paints the absurd picture 
of  reason  attempting in vain to make an 
inductive inference,  and needing  the imagi-
nation  to step in to lend a hand.  But induc-
tion is such a central cognitive process that 
it ought  by definition  to be an operation of 
 reason  (just as remembering is by definition 
an operation of  memory ); hence if we think 
of faculties as distinct agents or areas of the 
mind,   custom  – as the underlying process 
that drives induction – should itself be part 
of  reason . Presumably it is this sort of con-
sideration that led Hume,  in the wake of his 
famous argument,  to reassign ‘the general 
and more establish’d properties of the imagi-
nation’ – which must surely include custom – 
to  reason  or  the under standing  (THN 1.4.7.7 
/ 267,  cf. section 3.3 above).  121   But then we 
get into a muddle if we want to hold on to 
his conclusion that inductive inference is ‘not 
determin’d by reason’,  given the frequency 
with which he says that inductive inference is 
indeed determined by custom.  Little wonder , 
perhaps,  that both Hume and his interpreters 
sometimes seem to exhibit confusion of the 
faculties! 
 As so often,  the  Enquiry  brings consid-
erable improvement,  and in a number of 
respects.  Now the faculties are rarely spo-
ken of as agents in their own right,  with the 
harmless exception of those passages that stress the liberty of the imagination (EHU 
2.4 / 18,  5.10 / 47–8,  and 5.12 / 48–50).  The 
contrast is especially striking in the case of 
 reason , because whereas the  Treatise  speaks 
of reason itself as a determining cause (e.g.  
THN 1.3.6.4 / 88–9,  1.3.6.12 / 92,  1.3.7.6 
/ 97, 1.4.1.1 / 180),  the  Enquiry  never does 
so. In the later work,  Hume’ s preference is 
to talk instead of reasoning  processes  (e.g.  
EHU 4.23 / 39,  5.4 / 42,  9.6 / 108),  which 
were never mentioned as such in the  Treatise . 
Meanwhile,   custom  in the  Enquiry  is said 
to  act on  the imagination (EHU 5.11 / 48,  
9.5 / 106–7) and is never said (or implied) 
to be itself an operation of the imagination,  
thus avoiding the complications that arise 
from trying to place it consistently within the 
conventional faculty structure.  122   Moreover , 
Hume no longer refers to custom as a prin-
ciple of association of ideas (cf.  THN 1.3.7.6 
/ 97),  123   but says instead that it is a process 
 analog ous  to the association of ideas,  which 
‘is of a similar nature,  and arises from simi-
lar causes’ (EHU 5.20 / 53–4).  He continues,  
however , to draw a contrast between cus-
tom and reason (EHU 5.5 / 43,  5.20 / 53–4),  
thereby retaining the core of his theory that 
inductive inference is determined by a sub-
process which is not itself  cogniti ve .   
  4. CONCLUSION: SCEPTICISM AND 
RATION AL FOUND ATIONS 
 After all this,  how sceptical is Hume’ s pos-
ition? His famous argument has shown 
that inference from past to future crucially 
involves a process of extrapolation that can-
not be independently justified by anything 
within our cognitive grasp.  This crucial step 
is instead due to a mechanical associative 
process in the mind,  whereby past experience 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   879780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   87 4/17/2012   3:58:36 PM4/17/2012   3:58:36 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
88raises certain ideas about the future and enli-
vens them into beliefs.  Such a process – given 
its automatic,  non-reflective nature,  and its 
lack of any rational insight or apprehension 
of reality – is naturally classified as ‘imagina-
tive’ rather than ‘cognitive’,  and Hume’ s 
faculty language is best interpreted accord-
ingly, as a way of categorizing types of pro-
cess, rather than as a theory of distinct agents 
within our minds.  So when he claims that the 
 imagination  plays a crucial role in inductive 
inference,  he should be understood as saying 
simply that our process of making inductive 
inferences  itself  crucially involves an  imagi-
nation-lik e  sub-process.  
 As we have seen (in section 3.1 above),  
Hume is well aware that many inductive infer -
ences also involve  reason-lik e  sub-processes,  
as for example when we consciously take 
into account the ‘rules by which to judge of 
causes and effects’ of  Treatise  1.3.15 / 173–6,  
or attempt to identify underlying mathemat-
ical patterns (e.g.  EHU 4.13 / 31,  7.29n17 
/ 77n).  But he is clearly far more interested 
in the crucial  imaginati ve  step,  even to the 
extent of describing it as solely responsible 
for the inference: 
 When the mind .  . . passes from the idea 
or impression of one object to the idea 
or belief of another , it is not determin’d 
by reason,  . . . The inference .  . .  depends 
solely  on the union of ideas.  (THN 
1.3.6.12 / 92; emphasis added) 
 all reasonings are  nothing but   the effects 
of custom; .  . . (THN 1.3.13.11 / 149; 
emphasis added; cf.  EHU 5.5–6 / 43–4)   
 Similarly with his argument concerning our 
belief in the continued and distinct existence 
of body (which aims to show that it depends 
crucially on various associative processes,  
constructing ‘fictions’ from the passing show of impressions),  he expresses his conclusion 
in a way that ignores the obvious and essen-
tial role of the senses:
  That opinion must be  entirel y owing  to 
the  imagina tion  (THN 1.4.2.14 / 193; 
emphasis added).    
 Hume seems to be assuming here that even 
one  imaginati ve  step is sufficient to charac-
terize the entire process of which it is a part 
as one that is determined by  the imagination  
(rather than by  reason  or  the senses ), just as 
one invalid step within a sequential inference 
typically renders the entire inference invalid.  
Such a focus when speaking of inferential 
processes is indeed quite natural,  since we 
are typically interested in the  weakest  link in 
any chain of support rather than the  strong-
est . The same applies to other supportive or 
foundational relationships:  thus a climber can 
properly be described as ‘supported only by a 
rope’,  whether that rope itself is secured to a 
mountain,  a building,  a heavy vehicle or any 
other relatively reliable anchor .  124   Likewise,  
an argument or legal case which crucially 
depends on some imaginative fabrication,  
even if it  also  depends on numerous points 
that are logically unassailable,  can appro-
priately be said to be ‘founded on fantasy’.  
But if we follow through this line of thought,  
then since inductive inference depends on a 
sub-process of ‘imaginative’ extrapolation 
which itself has no rational grounding,  we 
seem forced to conclude that any proposition 
that can be established only by such infer -
ence must apparently in turn be disqualified 
from counting as founded on reason.  Yet as 
we have seen in sections 3.1 and 3.4 above,  
Hume continues to treat induction as a legit-
imate operation of reason.  125   There is,  at the 
least,  a sceptical tension here: can we really 
suppose that he would consider a process 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   889780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   88 4/17/2012   3:58:36 PM4/17/2012   3:58:36 PM89HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
genuinely  rational  which rests on a purely 
 mechanical ,  non-reflecti ve  sub-process? 
 To address this worry , suppose that Hume 
were to take the alternative view , that any 
rational process must have a rational foun-
dation.  It would then immediately follow 
that for anything to be founded on reason 
at all,  it must be founded on reason ‘all the 
way down’ (i.e.  it would have to be solidly 
founded on evidence or principles,  which 
are either immediately apprehended by 
reason,  or else themselves solidly founded 
on evidence or principles which are either 
immediately apprehended by reason or .  . . , 
etc.). Hume would thus be committed to a 
strongly rationalistic notion of reason,  the 
demands of which would be impossible to 
fulfil without abandoning the heart of his 
philosophy . At no point would he be able to 
halt the foundational regress by acknowledg-
ing that ultimately the principles of our rea-
son can (legitimately) be grounded on basic 
psychological mechanisms.  So the only pos-
sible outcomes would be either rationalism 
or incurable scepticism.  Some interpreters 
have indeed seen Hume as impelled towards 
radical scepticism by precisely this kind of 
regressive train of thought.  126   But it would 
be completely at odds with his efforts to 
ground a conception of reason on the con-
tingent operations of the human mind,  and 
flatly incompatible – in the light of his own 
investigations – with treating induction as a 
genuine operation of reason.  
 As we saw in section 3.4 above,  Locke 
implicitly follows the path that Hume rejects,  
by attributing probable reasoning to the per -
ception of probable connexions.  And indeed 
direct  perception  – conceived of as a process 
of transparent apprehension – seems to be a 
paradigm of what reason requires if it is to 
be ‘cognitive all the way down’.  Such percep-
tion could at once provide both a rational foundation for belief and also a cause.  By 
contrast,  ‘imagination-like’  processes such 
as custom may  cause  belief,  but they cannot 
at the same time provide a cognitive  foun-
dation : that is indeed precisely why they do 
not qualify as processes of reason.  127   Hume 
seems to have embraced this distinction,  if 
not perhaps immediately , for his language in 
the  Abstr act  and  Enquiry  (though not in the 
 Treatise ) precisely fits it.  In the  Treatise , he 
repeatedly talks about custom (or the prin-
ciples of the imagination) as providing a 
 foundation  for inductive inference.  128   In the 
 Abstr act  and  Enquiry , by contrast,  he never 
does,  but there are no fewer than 19 passages 
that describe the influence of custom in terms 
that are either explicitly  causal , or naturally 
interpretable as such.  129   This strongly sug-
gests that Hume himself came to recognize a 
firm distinction between what in the  Enquiry  
he calls a foundation,  and what he there calls 
a determining cause.  Thus understood,  it is 
clear that  custom  qualifies only as a  cause , 
whereas reasoning processes or sources of 
information can potentially provide a cogni-
tive  foundation .  130   
 All this brings the possibility of posing 
coherent but unanswerable questions,  such 
as that which introduces Hume’ s discussion 
in Part 2 of  Enquiry  Section 4: ‘if we still 
carry on our sifting humour , and ask,   What 
is the foundation of all conclusions from 
experience?  this implies a new question .  . .’ 
(EHU 4.14 / 32).  If  custom  cannot qualify 
as a  foundation , then Hume’ s ultimate con-
clusion that ‘All inferences from experience 
. . . are effects of custom,  not of reasoning’ 
(EHU 5.5 / 43) excludes any foundation at 
all. For in competing successfully for the 
 causal explanatory  role,  custom effectively 
excludes anything else from the  foundational  
role (which it is nevertheless unable to fulfil 
itself).  Perhaps,  then,  there is hidden depth

90  APPENDIX: HUME’S ARGUMENT CONCERNING INDUCTION 
(FROM SECTION  4  OF THE  ENQ UIRY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERST ANDING )    in Hume’ s declaration of intent: ‘I shall con-
tent myself,  in this section,  with an easy 
task, and shall pretend only to give a nega-
tive answer to the question here proposed’ 
(EHU 4.15 / 32).  The upshot is that ‘if we still 
carry on our sifting humour’ in the search 
for ultimate foundations,  we hit rock bot-
tom with something that has a  cause  but no 
 foundation . And that is the tendency , rooted 
in our animal nature,  to infer from past to 
future,  from experienced to not-yet-expe-
rienced.  This is radically different from the 
kind of perceptual foundation presupposed 
by traditional conceptions of reason,  differ -
ent enough to make Hume’ s position seem 
outrageously sceptical by comparison.  But in 
reality it is quite the reverse: he is providing 
an account of reason  which mak es inducti ve inference possible for human beings  , despite 
the sceptical impact of his famous argument 
which shows that it cannot be founded in any 
of the ways that previous tradition would 
countenance.  131   He reveals how we  actu-
ally  reason inductively , rather than falling 
back on the aprioristic supposition that this 
can only be through the rational perception 
of evidential connexions.  That traditional 
notion is decisively refuted by his sceptical 
argument,  but his own position is very far 
from sceptical.  On the contrary , as we saw in 
section 1 above,  Hume sees very good reason 
to accept our faculty of inductive inference 
as it is (at least when suitably disciplined by 
general rules etc.),  and no good reason to 
reject it.  We have,  indeed,  no alternative,  nor 
any compelling reason for desiring one.  132    
    Hume’ s Own Statement of the Propositions 
Identified in the Structure Diagr am  
  1.      By means of [ Cause and Effect ] alone 
can we go beyond the evidence of our 
memory and senses.  (EHU 4.4 / 26)  
  2.      All reasonings concerning matter of fact 
seem to be founded on the relation of 
 Cause and Effect.  (EHU 4.4 / 26) 
    . . . all arguments concerning existence 
are founded on the relation of cause and 
effect .  . . (EHU 4.19 / 35) 
    . . . all our evidence for any matter of 
fact, which lies beyond the testimony 
of sense or memory , is derived entirely 
from the relation of cause and effect .  . . 
(EHU 12.22 / 159)  
  3.      No object ever discovers,  by the quali-
ties which appear to the senses,  either 
the causes which produced it,  or the 
effects which will arise from it .  . . (EHU 
4.6 / 27)     It is allowed on all hands,  that there is 
no known connexion between the sen-
sible qualities and the secret powers .  . . 
(EHU 4.16 / 33)  
  4.     . . . every effect is a distinct event from its 
cause.  It could not,  therefore,  be discov-
ered in the cause,  and .  . . the conjunc-
tion of it with the cause must appear .  . . 
arbitrary; since there are always many 
other effects,  which,  to reason,  must 
seem fully as consistent and natural.  
(EHU 4.11 / 30)  
  5.     . . . the knowledge of [cause and effect] 
is not,  in any instance,  attained by rea-
sonings  a priori ; but arises entirely from 
experience .  . . (EHU 4.6 / 27) 
   . . .  causes and effects are discov er-
able, not b y reason,  but b y experience   
. . . (EHU 4.7 / 28) 
   In vain,  therefore,  should we pretend 
to . . . infer any cause or effect,   without

92the assistance of observation and experi-
ence.  (EHU 4.11 / 30) 
   . . . our knowledge of that relation [of 
cause and effect] is derived entirely from 
experience .  . . (EHU 4.19 / 35)  
  6.     . . . nor can our reason,  unassisted by 
experience,  ever draw any inference 
concerning real existence and matter of 
fact .  . . (EHU 4.6 / 27) 
   In vain,  therefore,  should we pretend 
to determine any single event .  . . with-
out the assistance of observation and 
experience.  (EHU 4.11 / 30)  
  7.     . . . we always presume,  when we see 
like sensible qualities,  that they have like 
secret powers,  and expect,  that effects,  
similar to those which we have experi-
enced,  will follow from them .  . . (EHU 
4.16 / 33) 
   We have said,  that .  . . all our experi-
mental conclusions proceed upon the  
supposition,  that the future will be con-
formable to the past .  . . (EHU 4.19 / 35)  
   . . . all inferences from experience sup-
pose,  as their foundation,  that the future 
will resemble the past,  and that similar 
powers will be conjoined with similar 
sensible qualities .  . . (EHU 4.21 / 37)  
  8.     [This proposition is implicit in the infer -
ential sequence:] We have said,  that all 
arguments concerning existence are 
founded on the relation of cause and 
effect; that our knowledge of that rela-
tion is derived entirely from experience; 
and that all our experimental conclu-
sions proceed upon the supposition,  
that the future will be conformable to 
the past.  (EHU 4.19 / 35)  
  9.     . . . the mind is not led to form such a 
conclusion concerning [sensible quali-
ties and secret powers’] constant and 
regular conjunction,  by any thing which 
it knows of their nature .  . . (EHU 4.16 
/ 33)  
  10.     [This proposition is implicit in Hume’ s 
transition from considering ‘a priori’ 
evidence for the Uniformity Principle to considering experiential arguments 
for it:] As to past  Experience , it can be 
allowed to give  direct  and  certain  infor -
mation of those precise objects only , 
and that precise period of time,  which 
fell under its cognizance: but why this 
experience should be extended to future 
times,  and to other objects,  which for 
aught we know , may be only in appear -
ance similar;  this is the main question 
on which I would insist.  (EHU 4.16 / 
33–4)  
  11.     The connexion between these proposi-
tions [ I hav e found that suc h an object 
has alw ays been attended with suc h an 
effect and I foresee,  that other objects,  
which are,  in appear ance,  similar , will 
be attended with similar effects  ] is not 
intuitive.  (EHU 4.16 / 34)  
  12.     There is required a medium,  which may 
enable the mind to draw such an infer -
ence,  if indeed it be drawn by reasoning 
and argument.  (EHU 4.16 / 34)  
  13.     All reasonings may be divided into two 
kinds,  namely demonstrative reasoning,  
or that concerning relations of ideas,  
and moral reasoning,  or that concern-
ing matter of fact and existence.  (EHU 
4.18 / 35)  
  14.     . . . it implies no contradiction,  that the 
course of nature may change .  . . May I 
not clearly and distinctly conceive [such 
a thing]? (EHU 4.18 / 35)  
  15.     That there are no demonstrative  argu-
ments in the case,  seems evident .  . . (EHU  
4.18 / 35)  
   . . . whatever is intelligible,  and can be 
distinctly conceived,  implies no contra-
diction,  and can never be proved false by 
any demonstrative argument or abstract 
reasoning  a priori  . . . (EHU 4.18 / 35)  
  16.     If we be,  therefore,  engaged by arguments 
to put trust in past experience,  and make 
it the standard of our future judgment,  
these arguments must be probable only , 
or such as regard matter of fact and real 
existence .  . . (EHU 4.19 / 35)  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   929780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   92 4/17/2012   3:58:39 PM4/17/2012   3:58:39 PM93HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
  17.     To endeavour , therefore,  the proof [that 
the future will be conformable to the 
past] by probable arguments,  or argu-
ments regarding existence,  must be evi-
dently going in a circle,  and taking that 
for granted,  which is the very point in 
question.  (EHU 4.19 / 35–6)  
  18.     . . . it may be requisite .  . . to shew , that 
none of [the branches of human knowl-
edge] can afford such an argument .  . . 
(EHU 4.17 / 35) 
   . . . we have no argument to convince  
us, that objects,  which have,  in our experi-
ence, been frequently conjoined,  will like-
wise, in other instances,  be conjoined in  
the same manner .  . . (EHU 12.22 / 159)   
  19.     . . . it is not reasoning which engages us  
to suppose the past resembling the future,  
and to expect similar effects from causes,  
which are,  to appearance,  similar .  . . 
(EHU 4.23 / 39)  
   . . . nothing leads us to [expect con-
stant conjunctions to continue] but cus-
tom or a certain instinct of our nature 
. . . (EHU 12.22 / 159)  
  20.     I say then,  that,  even after we have expe-
rience of the operations of cause and 
effect,  our conclusions from that experi-
ence are  not  founded on reasoning,  or 
any process of the understanding.  (EHU 
4.15 / 32) 
   . . . in all reasonings from experience,  
there is a step taken by the mind,  which  
is not supported by any argument or pro-
cess of the understanding.  (EHU 5.2 / 41)  
   All belief of matter of fact or real 
existence [is due merely to] a species of 
natural instincts,  which no reasoning or 
process of the thought and understand-
ing is able,  either to produce,  or to pre-
vent. (EHU 5.8 / 46–7)      
    NOTES 
  1     The argument appears in  Treatise  1.3.6 / 
86–94,   Abstr act  8–16 / 649–52,  and  Enquiry  4 / 25–39,  and is outlined in Sections 2.1–4 below . 
In discussions of induction it is commonly 
referred to as ‘Hume’ s famous argument’,  a 
convenient shorthand that I shall adopt.  Note 
also that ‘induction’ is the modern term for the 
topic of his argument; he himself never uses the 
word in this sense.   
  2     This is the summary of the Section 4 argument 
alluded to earlier . Note,  however , that the pre-
vious clause brings in a point from the Section 
7 discussion of the idea of necessary connexion,  
which does not feature in Section 4 itself.   
  3     Hume does not  reject  the Causal Maxim,  but 
says that it ‘must .  . . arise from observation  and 
experience’  (THN 1.3.3.9 / 82),  hinting that he 
will return to it later (though he never does).  For 
detailed discussion,  see Peter Millican,  ‘Hume’ s 
Determinism’,   Canadian  Journal of Philosoph y  
40 (2010),  pp. 611–42,  sects II,  IV, VI.  
  4     Section 1.3.7 will in due course move on to the 
third component,  ‘the nature and qualities’ of 
the belief-idea.   
  5     Hume continues to mention the  imagination’ s 
power to mix and separate its ideas (e.g.  
Abs. 35 / 662,  EHU 5.10 / 47–8),  but the 
Separability Principle as such is never again 
invoked as it had been,  very signifi  cantly , in the 
 Treatise  (e.g. THN 1.1.7.3 / 18–9,  1.2.3.10 / 
36–7,  1.2.5.3 / 54–5),  arguably sometimes with 
absurd results (e.g.  THN 1.4.3.7 / 222,  1.4.5.5 / 
233, 1.4.5.27 / 245–6,  App. 12 / 634).   
  6     At THN 1.3.2.11 / 77,  Hume had stressed 
that (single-case)  contiguity  and  succession  
are insuffi  cient to characterize a cause and 
effect relationship,  pointing out that ‘There 
is a  necess ary connexion  to be taken into 
consideration’.  Now at THN 1.3.6.3 / 87,  he 
reminds us that ‘Contiguity and succession are 
not suffi  cient to make us pronounce any two 
objects to be cause and effect’,  and he expresses 
satisfaction at having unexpectedly ‘discover’d 
a new relation .  . . This relation is their  con-
stant conjunction ’. The link between the 
passages is evident both from the content and 
the capitalization.

94conceptually guarantee the truth of the conclu-
sion. For more on this,  see Peter Millican,  
‘Humes Old and New: Four Fashionable 
Falsehoods,  and One Unfashionable Truth’,  
 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society , supp.  
vol. 81 (2007),  pp. 163–99,  sect.  V.  
  9     This result comes from Hume’ s theory of  
relations,  at THN 1.3.2.1–3 / 73–4 (for criti-
cism,  see Peter Millican,  ‘Hume’ s Fork,  and 
His Theory of Relations’,  forthcoming in  
 Philosoph y and Phenomenological Researc h ). 
In brief,  THN 1.1.5 / 13–15 enumerates what  
Hume takes to be the seven different kinds  
of relation,  which THN 1.3.1.1 / 69–70 then  
divides into two classes.  The four relations ‘that 
depend solely on ideas’ are the sources of strict  
‘knowledge’,  with  resemblance ,  contr ariety  and 
 degrees in quality  amenable to intuition (THN  
1.3.1.2 / 70),  and  proportions in quantity or  
number  the basis for demonstration.  Of the  
three ‘inconstant’ relations,   identity  and  rela-
tions of time and place  are amenable to percep-
tion (THN 1.3.2.2 / 73–4),  leaving  causation   
as ‘the only one,  that can be trac’d beyond our  
senses,  and informs us of existences and objects,  
which we do not see or feel’ (THN 1.3.2.3 /  
74). Hume thus identifi  es  probable  with  causal   
reasoning,  and the rest of Book 1,  Part 3,  
entitled ‘Of Knowledge and Probability’,  is 
accordingly devoted to ‘the idea of  causation   
. . . tracing it up to its origin’ (THN 1.3.2.4 /  
74–5).  Strangely , the word ‘probability’ does not  
appear at all in this Part before THN 1.3.6.4  
/ 89, except in the title of the Part itself and of  
Section 1.3.2: ‘Of Probability; and of the Idea of  
Cause and Effect’.   
  10     Notice that causal inference is categorically 
stated to be founded on that presumption – 
there is no suggestion here of the conditional-
ity that we had at THN 1.3.6.4 / 89: ‘ If  reason 
determin’d us,  it wou’d proceed upon that 
principle .  . .’ (emphasis added).  Nor is there 
any such conditionality at THN 1.3.6.11 / 
91–2,  or in either the  Abstr act  (Abs.  13–14 / 
651) or the  Enquiry  (EHU 4.19 / 35–6,  4.21 / 
36–7,  5.2 / 41–2).   
  11     THN 1.3.6.7 / 90 expresses the circularity in 
causal terms: ‘The same principle cannot be 
both the cause and effect of another’,  appar -
ently in order to make a joke: ‘and this is,  
perhaps,  the only proposition concerning that relation,  which is either intuitively or demon-
stratively certain’.  The  Abstr act  and  Enquiry  
make clear that the circularity is logical.   
  12     Before drawing this conclusion,  Hume adds 
(what I have called) a ‘coda’ to his argument 
(THN 1.3.6.8–10 / 90–1),  dismissing an 
attempt to get round it by appeal to objects’ 
powers.  This attempt is refuted by the simple 
observation that induction needs to be presup-
posed to enable us to draw an inference from 
the powers of past objects to the powers of 
future objects.  For discussion of this coda and 
its implications,  see Peter Millican,  ‘Hume’ s 
Sceptical Doubts concerning Induction’,  in 
Peter Millican (ed.),   Reading Hume on Human 
Under standing  (Oxford: Clarendon Press,  
2002),  pp. 107–73,  sects 9–9.2.   
  13     He also refers back to it in a footnote at THN 
1.3.14.17 / 163,  feeding into his discussion of 
the idea of necessary connexion.   
  14     For discussion of some of the nuances of termi-
nology for referring to this kind of reasoning,  
see Millican,  ‘Hume’ s Sceptical Doubts con-
cerning Induction’,  sect.  3.1, which distin-
guishes between  probable inference ,  factual 
inference ,  factual inference to the unobserv ed , 
and  inducti ve inference . Hume generally takes 
for granted that all of these coincide.   
  15     The argument from THN 1.3.6.8–10 / 90–1 is 
also very briefl  y summarized,  in the last two 
sentences of paragraph 15.  For more on this 
‘coda’,  see note 12 above.   
  16     Notice that Hume seems entirely happy to 
take perception and memory for granted here,  
fi tting with the strategy described in Section 1 
above,  of allowing default authority to our 
faculties.  Scepticism regarding the senses is 
addressed at THN 1.4.2–4 / 187–231 and 
EHU 12.6–16 / 151–5,  but Hume’ s ultimate 
attitude to it remains far less clear than his 
position on induction.   
  17     This notion of a  proof  plays a signifi  cant role 
in Hume’ s argument concerning miracles in 
Section 10 of the  Enquiry .  
  18     This is taken from Millican,  ‘Hume’ s Sceptical 
Doubts concerning Induction’.   
  19     Thus there is no evidence here,  as infl  uentially 
claimed by David Stove,   Probability and 
Hume’ s Inducti ve Scepticism  (Oxford: Oxford 
University Press,  1973),  p. 50, that Hume’ s 
method of argument shows him to be a

‘deductivist’,  presupposing that only deduc-
tively valid arguments are legitimate.  A similar 
point,  though less obvious,  can be made about 
the  Abstr act  (‘The mind can always  concei ve  
any effect to follow from any cause,  and 
indeed any event to follow upon another’,  
Abs. 11 / 650) and the  Treatise  (‘When we pass 
from a present impression to the idea of any 
object,  we might possibly .  . . have substituted 
any other idea in its room’,  THN 1.3.6.1 / 87).   
  20     This case of applied mathematics (cf.  also 
THN 2.3.3.2 / 413–14) shows that Hume 
is quite comfortable with demonstrative,  
mathematical reasoning being applied to a pos-
teriori premises.  For discussion of this point,  
see Millican,  ‘Humes Old and New’,  sect.  V.  
  21     Hume’ s talk of ‘secret powers’ is new in the 
 Enquiry , and seems to refl  ect a more sophis-
ticated understanding of scientifi  c reasoning 
than is evident in the  Treatise  and  Abstr act . 
In the  Treatise , science is generally treated 
as involving predictions of discrete types of 
event based on previous patterns of conjunc-
tion or difference (as in the ‘rules by which to 
judge of causes and effects’ of THN 1.3.15 / 
173–6).  The  Enquiry , by contrast,  evinces an 
awareness (e.g.  at EHU 4.13 / 31 and EHU 
7.29n17 / 77n) that science more typically 
deals with events having continuously vary-
ing characteristics – such as the velocity of a 
billiard ball – whose prediction involves the 
interplay of mathematically determined forces.  
For more on this,  see Peter Millican,  ‘Against 
the New Hume’,  in Rupert Read and Kenneth 
A. Richman (eds),   The New Hume Debate: 
Revised Edition  (London: Routledge,  2007),  
pp. 211–52,  at pp.  232–3.   
  22     Hume obviously means us to infer accord-
ingly – though he does not explicitly state – 
that [8] all factual reasoning,  since it has to 
be founded on experience,  presupposes such a 
resemblance (i.e.  the Uniformity Principle).  See 
also note 27 below .  
  23     In EHU 4.16 / 33–4 itself,  Hume oscillates 
between reference to the activity of  inference  
from observed to unobserved,  and to the 
 presupposition  of resemblance on which such 
inference is based.  Indeed it seems that he takes 
the foundation of the  inference  to be the same 
as the foundation of the  presupposition  that it 
manifests.  This supports an interpretation of the Uniformity Principle as implicit rather than 
explicit,  a principle we  exhibit  by our infer -
ential behaviour rather than one we always 
consciously consider . Such an interpretation 
nicely squares Hume’ s repeated commitment 
to the Principle’ s role in all inductive inference 
(see note 10) with his clear recognition at THN 
1.3.8.13 / 103–4 that we characteristically 
‘draw inferences from past experience,  without 
refl ecting on .  . . that principle’.  See also note 
31 below .  
  24     This suggests that if the inference  were  intui-
tive, it would count as ‘reasoning and argu-
ment’ notwithstanding the lack of a ‘medium’.  
Indeed,  as we shall see later (section 3.1),  in 
Hume’ s day the terms ‘reasoning’ and ‘argu-
ment’ did not imply complex ratiocination.   
  25     Hume is fond of elegant variation,  frequently  
using a variety of terms for the same concept.  
‘Moral reasoning’,  ‘reasoning concerning  
matter of fact and real existence’,  ‘probable  
arguments’ and ‘arguments concerning exist-
ence’ are all ways of referring to what we are  
here calling  factual  reasoning.  See note 14  
above.   
  26     That he takes these to be equivalent was 
made clear by EHU 4.2 / 25–6,  where he fi  rst 
explained the notion of a matter of fact.   
  27     For an earlier occurrence of this last implicit 
inference,  see note 22 above.   
  28     As in the  Treatise  (note 12 above) and  Abstr act  
(note 15 above),  Hume rounds off the argu-
ment in the  Enquiry  with a coda (EHU 4.21 
/ 36–8) in which he refutes the attempt to 
circumvent his argument by appeal to objects’ 
powers.  He also adds a parting shot at EHU 
4.23 / 39 which emphasises the unlikelihood 
that peasants,  infants or ‘brute beasts’ should 
form their inductive expectations on the basis 
of ‘any process of argument or ratiocination’.  
Though the point is well made,  however , its 
philosophical signifi  cance is less clear , because 
those who take induction to be rationally 
founded need not be committed to supposing 
that animals (etc.) function purely ration-
ally – see Millican,  ‘Hume’ s Sceptical Doubts 
concerning Induction’,  sect.  9.3.  
  29     Recall that [12] is the claim that ‘There is 
required a medium,  which may enable the 
mind to draw such an inference,  if indeed 
it be drawn by reasoning and argument’.  
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   959780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   95 4/17/2012   3:58:40 PM4/17/2012   3:58:40 PMHUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
96(EHU 4.16 / 34) – that is,  because the 
Uniformity Principle cannot be established 
directly through sensory perception or intui-
tion, if it is to be established by reason at all,  
then this must be on the basis of some step-
wise argument or ratiocination.   
  30     The other implicit fi  nal stages are also stated 
explicitly elsewhere: [18] ‘we have no argu-
ment to convince us,  that objects,  which have,  
in our experience,  been frequently conjoined,  
will likewise,  in other instances,  be conjoined 
in the same manner’ (EHU 12.22 / 159); [19] 
‘it is not reasoning which engages us to sup-
pose the past resembling the future,  and to 
expect similar effects from causes,  which are,  
to appearance,  similar’ (EHU 4.23 / 39).   
  31     See note 23 above for the nature of this 
presupposition,  which need not be conscious,  
but is implicitly  manifested  by the making of 
the inference.  So UP need not take any very 
explicit or determinate form (contrary to the 
impression given by THN 1.3.6.4 / 88–9),  and 
is best understood as something like a general 
principle of  evidential relev ance  between 
observed and unobserved,  more in line with 
the expression of the  Enquiry : ‘we . . . put trust 
in past experience,  and make it the standard 
of our future judgment’ (EHU 4.19 / 35); we 
take ‘the past [as a] rule for the future’ (EHU 
4.21 / 38).  This seems right: in taking such an 
inference to be better informed than an a priori 
inference,  we are  ipso f acto  presuming that 
what happened in the past provides evidence 
that is positively relevant to what will happen 
in the future.  For more on the Uniformity 
Principle and its presupposition,  see Millican,  
‘Hume’ s Sceptical Doubts concerning 
Induction’,  sect.  3.2 and especially sect.  10.2.   
  32     Moreover this sequence of argument seems to 
be entirely deliberate,  because it occurs very 
explicitly twice,  fi rst within the main argument 
at EHU 4.16 / 32–4,  and then again in the 
coda at EHU 4.21 / 37.   
  33     In the conclusion of Book 1 of the  Treatise , 
Hume’ s attempt to meet the sceptical challenge 
says very little about the issue of induction,  
except as part of a general concern regarding 
the role of ‘the imagination,  or the vivacity 
of our ideas’ (THN 1.4.7.3 / 265).  There the 
more pressing problems are those that threaten 
inevitable error and contradiction (notably the existence of body , the metaphysics of 
causation,  and the self-annihilation of reason),  
which the simple assumption of uniformity 
never does.  The  Enquiry ’s response to the 
Pyrrhonian sceptic,  starting from a rejection 
of extreme  antecedent  scepticism,  would not 
be nearly as effective against varieties of  con-
sequent  scepticism that bring to light genuine 
contradictions – rather than simply lack of 
ultimate grounding – in our faculties,  and this 
might explain why Hume very much down-
plays these more problematic topics in the 
 Enquiry . His attitude to them seems to be that 
they are best left alone: for example,  meta-
physical enquiries into the nature of matter 
are likely to lead to contradiction or unin-
telligibility (EHU 12.14–15 / 153–5) unless,  
perhaps,  we fall back on a notion of matter so 
empty as to be unexceptionable (EHU 12.16 
/ 155).  Hume’ s fi nal recommendation is for a 
 mitig ated  scepticism that inspires a suitable 
degree of ‘doubt,  and caution,  and modesty’ 
(EHU 12.24 / 162),  and which also focuses our 
enquiries on ‘such subjects as are best adapted 
to the narrow capacity of human understand-
ing’ (EHU 12.25 / 162),  notably those where 
we are able to progress either through math-
ematical demonstration (EHU 12.27 / 163) or 
induction from experience (EHU 12.28–31 / 
163–6).

  39     Stroud himself ( Hume , pp. 56–7) reacted 
against this,  suggesting that what he saw as 
Hume’ s extreme scepticism could more plau-
sibly be attributed to a ‘potentially regressive 
aspect of the notion of reason or justifi  cation’ 
whereby evidence  E  can count as a reason 
for believing  P  only if one has some reason  R  
for taking  E  as a reason.  If we then ask about 
the basis for  R  in turn,  and continue in this 
way, we get a regress which can apparently 
be terminated only by ‘something we could 
not fail to be reasonable in believing’ (ibid.,

p. 62), such as an immediate experience or self-
evident truth.  Hume’ s invoking of UP within 
his argument is indeed somewhat in this spirit,  
but when considering UP’ s own foundation,  he 
seems content to stop with (fallible) sensa-
tion or memory , not only with the certainty of 
intuition or demonstration,  while the appeal 
to factual inference generates a circle rather 
than an infi  nite regress.  Nevertheless Stroud’ s 
account is illuminating,  in stressing the seduc-
tive assumption that justifi  cation is required at 
each step if scepticism is to be resisted.  Hume’ s 
strategy outlined in Section 1 above rejects this 
by shifting the onus onto the sceptic.

which are discussed by Don Garrett,   Cognition

  45     Most obviously , the famous argument treats 
 probable  argument as a potential founda-
tion for the Uniformity Principle,  whereas a deductivist must consider any merely probable 
argument as evidentially worthless from the 
start.  If Hume were a deductivist,  indeed,  
then he could dismiss induction in a single 
step with his Conceivability Principle.  For 
more detail on all this,  see Millican,  ‘Hume’ s 
Argument concerning Induction’,  pp. 123–4,

more detail,  ‘Hume’ s Sceptical Doubts concern-
ing Induction’,  sect.  2). Note that both of these

teristic which Owen considers fundamental to 
Lockean reason.

Meaning of Hume’ s Conclusion concerning 
“Inductive”  Inferences’ (in Peter Millican,

pp. 332–4) was based directly on the two

  54     Or, presumably ,  A  to  C . Garrett’ s suggestion 
(‘Ideas,  Reason and Skepticism’,  pp. 182–3) 
is that in attempting to infer from  A  to  D , we 
fi rst observe that  A  implies  B  intuitively (i.e.  
self-evidently),  leaving a gap between  B  and 
 D . We then set out to fi  ll that gap,  by noticing 
that  B  implies  C , and  C  implies  D . We put

98these last two implications together , deducing 
that  B  implies  D  (this is Garrett’ s intermedi-
ate inference).  Now from  A implies B  and  B 
implies D , we can deduce that  A implies D .  
  55     See, for example,  Peter Millican,  ‘Hume on 
Reason and Induction: Epistemology or 
Cognitive Science?’,   Hume Studies  24 (1998),  
pp. 141–60,  at pp.  145–7,  and David Owen,  ‘A 
Reply to My Critics’,   Hume Studies  26 (2000),  
pp. 323–37,  at pp.  329–30.

Language  (London,  1756).   
  57     ‘To deduce’ is defi  ned in three clauses: ‘1. 
To draw in a regular connected series.  2. 
To form a regular chain of consequential 
propositions.  3. To lay down in regular order’.  
‘Ratiocination’ is defi  ned in just one clause: 
‘The act of reasoning; the act of deducing 
consequences from premises’.   
  58     Also,  of course,  Hume’ s own theory of induct-
ive inference implies that it typically does not 
proceed in a stepwise manner , but essentially 
reduces to  conception  (see THN 1.3.7.5n20 / 
96–7n); yet he never hints that terms such as 
‘argument’,  ‘inference’,  ‘proof ’ or ‘reasoning’ 
are thereby rendered inappropriate to these 
transitions of thought.  So it is hard to see how 
he could consistently refuse to apply them – on 
grounds of immediacy – to ‘intuitive inference’.   
  59     Such an emphasis comes later , with the positive 
account in terms of instinctive custom (e.g.  at 
THN 1.3.8.13 / 103–4 and EHU 5.8 / 46–7).   
  60     At least,  this looks like a plausible implication,  
just as one invalid step within a mathemat-
ical proof is enough to render the entire proof 
invalid.  But as we shall see later (section 4),  
things are not quite so straightforward here.   
  61     For another way of sharpening this sort of 
objection,  see Millican,  ‘Humes Old and New , 
sect. VI, which expands on Millican,  ‘Sceptical 
Doubts concerning Induction’,  pp. 158–60.  
There I focus on the very last step of Hume’ s 
argument,  whereby he concludes that because 
factual inference is founded on UP , and UP is 
not founded on reason,  it follows that factual 
inference is not founded on reason.  This step 
looks very dubious if ‘reason’ here is supposed 
to mean stepwise ratiocination (or , indeed,  
higher -level argument).   
  62     See note 10 above for equivalent passages in 
the  Abstr act  and  Enquiry  versions.     63     See for example Owen,   Hume’ s Reason , 
pp. 9–10,  120–2,  127–30,  141,  148.  The books  
of both Owen and Garrett present only the  
 Treatise  version of the argument,  and indeed  
Owen’ s analysis hardly mentions the  Abstr act  
or  Enquiry . Garrett takes relevant quotations  
from the later works,  but states without analysis  
that ‘the structure and language of the other ver -
sions of the argument are parallel’ to that in the  
 Treatise  ( Cognition and Commitment , p. 82).  
  64     Descartes’ s  Meditations , for example,  presents 
the Ontological Argument for the existence 
of a perfect God,  and then appeals to God’ s 
non-deceptive nature to vindicate various 
factual beliefs about the unobserved,  all appar -
ently without any essential reference to the 
Uniformity Principle.   
  65     Or – if we take the  Enquiry  version – in any 
deliverance of the senses or intuition.   
  66     This objection goes back to my ‘Hume on 
Reason and Induction’,  sect.  VII (1998),  and is 
also discussed by Garrett,  ‘Ideas,  Reason and 
Skepticism’,  p. 187; Millican ‘Hume’ s Sceptical 
Doubts concerning Induction’,  pp. 157–8; 
Louis Loeb,  ‘Psychology , Epistemology , 
and Skepticism in Hume’ s Argument about 
Induction’,   Synthese  152 (2006),  pp. 321–38,  
at pp.  328–9; and Abraham Sesshu Roth,  
‘Causation’,  in Saul Traiger (ed.),   The 
Blackwell Guide to Hume’ s Treatise  (Oxford: 
Blackwell,  2006),  pp. 95–113,  at pp.  108–11.   
  67     The case of faulty  factual  arguments (e.g.  in 
Hume’ s coda at  THN  1.3.6.10 / 91 and  EHU  
4.21 / 36–8) is less clear , because if they pre-
suppose UP , then the famous argument – as 
interpreted by Garrett and Owen – can still 
get a purchase on them.  For critical discus-
sion, see Loeb,  ‘Psychology , Epistemology , and 
Skepticism’ (p.  329),  who goes on to suggest 
his own explanation of why Hume fails to 
consider faulty arguments here: ‘The answer 
must be that Hume imposes an epistemic 
constraint on any causal explanation of induct-
ive inference: the explanation of our making 
inductive inferences must be compatible with 
their being justifi  ed’ (p.  330).  Helen Beebee,  
 Hume on Causation  (London: Routledge,  
2006),  pp. 55–6,  takes a similar line,  and both 
are discussed in my ‘Humes Old and New’,  
pp. 186–8.  In brief,  I fi nd their approach text-
ually unsupported and also in tension with 
9780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   989780826443595_Ch03_Final_txt_print.indd   98 4/17/2012   3:58:40 PM4/17/2012   3:58:40 PM99HUME’S ‘SCEPTICISM’ ABOUT INDUCTION
the sceptical tone of Hume’ s famous argument 
and of his later references to it.  A far simpler 
solution is to see ‘reason’ as referring to our 
 cogniti ve  faculty – see section 3.2 below .

Questions and Diffi  culties in Mor als  (London: 
1758),  p. 34.  
  69     Ibid.,  p. 40n.   
  70     Owen also adds a note at this point: ‘The 
qualifi  cation,  “prior to our engaging in 
probable reasoning”,  is important,  because 
Hume thinks that once we are engaged in 
the practice of probable reasoning,  we come 
to believe the uniformity principle and use it 
in probable  reasoning.  . . . This requires an 
account of how we fi  rst engage in probable 
reasoning,   before  the principle is available to 
us’. ( Hume’ s Reason , p. 128n30)

  74     Garrett,  ‘Ideas,  Reason and Skepticism’,  
pp. 180–1.   
  75     Unlike Garrett and Owen,  however , I do not 
take the principle in question,  ‘ that lik e objects,  
plac’d in lik e circumstances,  will alw ays 
produce lik e effects ’, to be identical to the 
Uniformity Principle.  The former concerns the 
 consistenc y  of events within our experience,  
whereas UP concerns the  evidential relev ance  
of observed to unobserved.  Without UP , 
experienced consistency (or , indeed,  any other 
experienced pattern) could not be extrapolated 
from past to future.

  79     This is the main respect in which my own 
views have changed over time,  largely in 
response to Don Garrett’ s criticisms.  Most 
other aspects of my previous interpretation 
remain in place; for example it will become 
clear in Section 4 below that a  perceptual  
notion of reason makes a highly plausible 
Humean target,  even if we do not suppose that 
he was employing such a notion himself within 
the famous argument.

  83     Ibid. It seems to be a  logical  rather  than  psycho-
logical  point that some such step must be pre-
sent in every inductive  inference,  given that – as  
Garrett  acknowledges  – the ‘supposition  of UP’  
that it exhibits  can be entirely  unconscious.   
  84     Locke starts his chapter ‘Of Reason’ ( Essay , 
IV.xvii) with the remark that ‘ The W ord 
Reason  in the  English  Language  has different 
Signifi  cations : sometimes it is taken for true,  
and clear Principles: Sometimes for clear , and 
fair deductions from those Principles: and 
sometimes for the Cause,  and particularly the 
fi nal Cause’.  He then goes on to say that his 
chapter concerns yet another signifi  cation,  
for that ‘Faculty in Man .  . . whereby Man is 
supposed to be distinguished from Beasts,  and 
wherein it is evident he much surpasses them’.  
Earlier , at  Essay  II.xxi.17–20,  Locke ridi-
cules the language of ‘faculties’ as a source of 
philosophical error . For more on his view , see 
Millican,  ‘Hume’ s Sceptical Doubts concerning 
Induction’,  sect.  2, and cf.  note 50 above.

does the same,  albeit more rarely (DNR 3.153,  
3.156),  though he quite often refers in a simi-
lar spirit to the ‘intellectual faculties’ (THN

  98     Price deprecates ‘the division which has  
been made by some writers,  of all the  
powers of the soul into understanding  and 
will; the former comprehending under it,  
all the powers of external and internal  
sensation,  as well as those of judging and  
reasoning’.  By contrast,  he says,  ‘I all along  
speak of the understanding,  in the most  
confi ned and proper sense of it .  . . and 
distinguished  from the powers of sensation’  
( Review , I.ii, p. 20n).  Note,  however , that 
Price implicitly equates  the under standing   
with  reason  (ibid.,  p. 23) thus using ‘reason’  
in a broader sense than those such as Kames  
(cf. note 92 above) who exclude   intuition   
from its scope.

Hutcheson sees as playing an important role 
in both imagination and memory; sect.  7 
briefl y discusses what is pleasing or distress-
ing to the senses,  and our consequent judge-
ments (of good and evil) and passions; then 
sect. 8 discusses habit,  and sect.  9 relative

  104     Other passages that identify reason with the 
discovery of truth,  though usually less expli-
citly, are at THN 2.3.3.3 / 414,  2.3.3.5–6 
/ 415–6,  2.3.3.8 / 417,  3.1.1.4 / 456–7,  
3.1.1.19n69 / 464n,  3.1.1.25–7 / 467–70,  
3.2.2.20 / 496,  THN App. 1 / 623; EPM 1.7 
/ 172,  EPM App. 1.6 / 287.  All of these occur 
in a context where Hume is contrasting 
 reason  (or  the under standing ) with conative 
rather than cognitive notions,  thus corrob-
orating its identifi  cation as the overarching 
cognitive faculty .  
  105     This note (which can be found as a Textual 
Variant on p.  177 of my edition of Hume’ s 
 Enquiry concerning Human Under standing , 
Oxford World’s Classics,  2007) is of particu-
lar interest because it credits Hutcheson with 
distinguishing between ‘the Understanding’ 
and ‘That Faculty .  . . by which we perceive 
Vice and Virtue’,  although Hutcheson himself 
considered the moral sense to be one of the 
‘refl exive or subsequent sensations’,  thus fall-
ing within the domain of the understanding.  
Price,   Review , p. 12n,  mentions Hume’ s note 
in the course of criticizing Hutcheson.   
  106     Notice that Hume is implying that  if  we 
could observe a conjunction of cause and 
effect,   then  we could form such a ‘conclu-
sion .  . . concerning .  . . existence’ and ‘satisfy 
our reason in this particular’.  So as in the 
famous argument concerning morals (cf.  the 
quotation from THN 3.1.1.12 / 459 near 
the beginning of section 3.1 above),  Hume is 
clearly here treating causal,  factual inference 
as an operation of reason.   
  107     Such nuances can apply with many words that  
are associated with some  achievement . For 
example,  a  cure  that does not work is strictly a  
contradiction in terms,  but it is fairly natural to  
say, in appropriate circumstances,  ‘that cure is  
useless and ought to be banned’.   
  108     An analogy here would be to an  accounting 
error  within a company , which on a broad 
interpretation could refer to any error in the 
accounts (including faulty data from external 
sources),  but on a narrower interpretation 
would mean an error due to the accountants 
themselves.   
  109     On the conative side,  Hume hardly ever 
speaks of ‘faculties’,  explicitly referring to ‘the 
will’ and ‘the passions’ as faculties just once each (at THN 2.3.3.9 / 417–8 and 2.2.2.16 / 
339 respectively).  Judgemental ‘taste’ is called 
a faculty in ‘Of the Standard of Taste’,  E 
240–1,  and spoken of as having ‘a product-
ive faculty’ in a famous passage at EPM App. 
1.21 / 294.   
  110     The model of a canvas is obviously most 
appropriate to visual ideas,  which indeed 
seem to dominate Hume’ s thought,  although 
ideas may correspond to any of the senses – 
including internal ‘refl ection’ – and only the 
ideas of sight and touch will be spatially 
arranged (not necessarily within a single 
space).  Note that he takes  all  of our ideas to 
be sense-copied; hence as Garrett observes (cf.  
note 90 above),  Hume denies any separate 
faculty that can take a ‘pure and intellectual 
view’ of ‘refi n’d and spiritual’ ideas,  unsullied 
by sensory input (THN 1.3.1.7 / 72).   
  111     At least,  this seems to be what Hume is saying 
in THN 1.4.7.3 / 265.  At THN 1.3.9.3 / 
107–8,  he appears instead to take the force 
and vivacity of the ‘impressions or ideas of 
the memory’ – like that of ‘an immediate 
impression’ – as itself constituting assent,  
thus providing a basis for explaining the 
assent that derives from causal inference.  
The relationship between memory and the 
imagination remains somewhat obscure,  
though Hume’ s talk of ‘impressions of 
the memory’ (‘somewhat intermediate 
betwixt an impression and an idea’,  THN 
1.1.3.1 / 8) suggests that the memory is 
furnishing ideas that are suffi  ciently fi  rm 
and vivid – suffi  ciently impression-like – to 
establish copy-ideas in the imagination: 
‘The impressions of the memory never 
change in any considerable degree; and 
each impression draws along with it a 
precise idea,  which takes its place in the 
imagination,  as something solid and real,  
certain and invariable’.  (THN 1.3.9.7 / 110).  
If this is right,  then all the ideas that are 
actually involved in  thinking  lie within the 
imagination,  and the role of the senses and 
memory is to supply the ‘impressions’ from 
which those ideas derive.

102  113     I call it a ‘virtual’ stage to refl  ect Hume’ s 
comment at THN 1.4.6.4 / 253 that ‘The 
comparison of the theatre must not mislead 
us. They are the successive perceptions only , 
that constitute the mind’.   
  114     THN 1.4.2.22 / 198 gives a case intermedi-
ate between passivity and activity , in which  
the imagination,  having been ‘set into any  
train of thinking,  is apt to continue even  
when its object fails it,  and,  like a galley  
put in motion by the oars,  carries on its  
course without any new impulse’.  Note that  
the listed references involving  fi ctions   are 
confi ned to those that involve characteristic  
Humean fi  ctions of philosophical interest,  
rather than arbitrary combinations of ideas  
(i.e. ‘mere fi ctions of the imagination’ as at  
THN 1.3.5.4–5 / 85,  1.3.7.7 / 97,  1.3.9.3 /  
108, 1.4.3.1 / 219; EHU 5.12–13 / 49–50,  
6.3 / 57).   
  115     Recall from Section 3.2 that the replaced 
footnote at THN 2.2.7.6n / 371n said ‘the 
understanding’ here instead of ‘reason’.   
  116     It is striking,  for example,  that these are the 
only two occurrences in Hume’ s writings 
of the phrase ‘offspring of the imagina-
tion’.  Presumably he was forced to place the 
footnote at the end of the section to minimize 
type resetting.   
  117     The understanding is also identifi  ed with 
the imagination at THN 1.3.8.13 / 104 and 
2.3.9.10 / 440.   
  118     Don Garrett,   Cognition and Commitment , 
p. 92, was,  I believe,  the fi  rst to note this 
possibility , which is crucial if Hume’ s use of 
‘reason’ within his argument is to be under -
stood as sincere rather than a target.  But of 
course Garrett’ s interpretation of ‘determin’d 
by reason’ is very different from my own.   
  119     See, for example,  EHU 1.13–14 / 13–14 for 
the equation of ‘faculties’ with ‘powers’,  and 
also THN Intro.  4 / xv , 1.3.10.9 / 123.  The 
same equation is repeatedly found in Locke,  
e.g.  Essay  II.vi.2,  II xxi 15,  17, 20.  
  120     Locke,   Essay , II.xxi.20.   
  121     In a recent debate (Don Garrett and Peter 
Millican,   Reason,  Induction and Causation in 
Hume’ s Philosoph y , IASH Occasional Paper 
19, Edinburgh: Institute for Advanced Studies 
in the Humanities,  University of Edinburgh,  
2011),  Don Garrett argues that in inductive inference,  ‘the imagination in the narrow 
sense is performing the customary transition’ 
(p. 22), thus denying that  custom  is reassigned 
to  reason  along with ‘our demonstrative 
and probable reasonings’.  Hence he sees the 
distinction alluded to at THN 1.3.9.19n22 / 
117–18 as quite distinct from that drawn at 
THN 1.4.4.1 / 225,  a position I fi  nd rather 
implausible,  given that their stated rationale 
is so similar , namely , to distinguish within 
the imagination between the principles that 
‘are the foundation of all our thoughts and 
actions’ and those that give rise to ‘whimsies 
and prejudices’.   
  122     Even in the  Treatise , Hume never says in so 
many words that custom is a process of the 
imagination,  though THN 1.3.6.4 / 88–9 and 
1.3.7.6 / 97 strongly suggest this.   
  123     In the  Enquiry , unlike the  Treatise  (e.g. THN 
1.3.6.16 / 94,  1.3.8.6 / 100–1),  Hume is care-
ful to distinguish between the associational 
relation of causation (discussed at EHU 
5.18–19 / 53) and custom (EHU 5.20 / 53–4).   
  124     We would not usually describe the climber as 
‘supported only by’ a rock to which the rope 
is attached unless the rock was considered 
potentially  less  secure than the rope (e.g.  
suppose the attachment is to a spur of rock 
that is in imminent danger of cracking – 
we might well then say that the climber is 
‘supported only by the spur’).   
  125     Together with those quoted earlier , relevant 
passages include: ‘. . . our reason .  . . or, more 
properly speaking,  . . . those conclusions 
we form from cause and effect .  . .’ (THN 
1.4.4.15 / 231); ‘. . . these emotions extend 
themselves to the causes and effects of that 
object,  as they are pointed out to us by rea-
son and experience .  . .’ (2.3.3.3 / 414); ‘. . . 
the operations of human understanding .  . . 
[include] the inferring of matter of fact .  . .’ 
(3.1.1.18 / 463).   
  126     Both Barry Stroud ( Hume , pp. 60–2) and 
John Kenyon (‘Doubts about the Concept 
of Reason’,   Proceedings of the Aristotelian 
Society , supp.  vol. 59, 1985,  pp. 249–67,  
at pp.  255–7) attribute this to Hume in the 
context of his argument concerning induction,  
but neither justifi  es the attribution,  and there 
is little evidence of it in Hume’ s text (cf.  note 
39 above).

  127     This assumes the internalist perspective  
which dominated the early modern period.  A 
modern Humean might well take an externalist  
approach,  but given Hume’ s explicit response  
to the sceptic in  Enquiry  12 (as described  
in section 1 above),  I am not persuaded by  
Louis Loeb’ s claim that ‘In light of the massive  
evidence that Hume is not a skeptic about  
induction,  he must reject [the] internalist way  
of thinking’.  (‘Psychology , Epistemology , and 
Skepticism’,  p. 333).  Kenneth Winkler empha-
sizes how Enquiry 12 supports a more sceptical  
reading of Enquiry 4: see ‘Hume’ s Inductive  
Skepticism’,  in Margaret Atherton (ed.),  
The Empiricists (Lanham,  MD: Rowman &  
Littlefi  eld, 1999),  pp. 183–212,  at pp.  193–200.

that this contrast cannot be accounted for in 
terms of Hume’ s moving away from the foun-
dational metaphor more generally . On the 
contrary , he says that induction is ‘founded’ 
on the relation of cause and effect,  or experi-
ence,  or the Uniformity Principle,  and that it 
is  not  ‘founded’ on reasoning,  argument,  or any process of the understanding,  signifi  -
cantly more in the  Enquiry  – EHU 4.4 / 26,  
4.14 / 32 (twice),  4.15 / 32,  4.21 / 37,  9.5 /

 Treatise  – THN 1.3.6.4 / 88 and 1.3.6.7 / 
89–90 (twice).   
  130     Other aspects of the logic of Hume’ s foun-
dational relation are explored in Millican,  
‘Hume’ s Sceptical Doubts concerning 
Induction’,  sect.  10.1.   
  131     There is a thematic parallel here with Hume’ s 
account of causation,  which is also commonly 
thought of as sceptical,  but in fact provides 
him with a positive basis for applying causal 
explanation to the human world.  For more 
on this,  see Peter Millican,  ‘Hume,  Causal 
Realism,  and Causal Science’,   Mind  118 
(2009),  pp. 647–712.   
  132     For numerous discussions  on the topics of 
reason and induction,  I am extremely grateful 
to Louis Loeb,  David Owen and especially 
Don Garrett,  as well as many other members 
of the Hume Society at its various conferences.  
I am also grateful to Henry Merivale,  Hsueh 
Qu and especially Dan O’Brien for comments 
on this paper , and to the Edinburgh Illumni 
for providing the David Hume Fellowship  at 
Edinburgh,  thus giving me the opportunity to 
work in the delightful context of the Institute 
for Advanced Studies in the Humanities,  over -
lapping with Don Garrett’ s tenure there.
