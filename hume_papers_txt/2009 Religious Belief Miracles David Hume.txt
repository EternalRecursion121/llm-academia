Some Basic Probability 
Probabilities range from 0 to 1.  If a proposition has a probability 
of 0, then it’s certainly false; if 1, then it’s certainly true.  A proposition with a probability of ½ (or 0.5, or 50%) is equally likely to be true as false, and a proposition with a probability of 
¾ (or 0.75, or 75%) is three times as likely to be true as false. 
If two propositions are mutually exclusive  (i.e. they can’t both be 
true together), then the probability that at least one of them is true is equal to the sum of the individual probabilities.  So if the 
probability that Teasing Tom will win the race is 0.3 (or 30%), 
and the probability that Jumping Jane will win is 0.25 (or 25%), then the probability that either  Teasing Tom or Jumping Jane 
will win the race is 0.55, or 55%: 
 Pr(T or J) = Pr(T) + Pr(J) = 0.3 + 0.25 = 0.55  2If two propositions are independent  – so the truth or falsehood of 
one of them has no impact whatever on the probability of the 
other – then the probability that both of them are true is simply 
the product of the two individual probabilities.  So if Jumping Jane moves to the weaker second race to improve her chances, giving Teasing Tom a 40% chance of winning the first race, and 
Jumping Jane a 60% chance of winning the second, then the 
probability that they’ll both win their respective races is: 
 Pr(T and J) = Pr(T) × Pr(J) = 0.4 × 0.6 = 0.24 (i.e. 24%) 
 
Often, the probability of one event depends on another, and we 
can get sequences of dependent events.  Suppose, for example, 
I have a 0.8 probability of catching the 12:00 train for Reading 
(R), and if I manage to catch that train, I will then have a 0.6 
probability of catching the 12:45 train for Didcot (D).  The 
probability that I will catch both trains is then 0.8 × 0.6 = 0.48, 
slightly less than half.  So the relevant equation in this case is: 
    Pr(R & D) = Pr(R) × Pr(D | R) 
where “Pr(D | R)” represents the probability of D given  R.  3(b)  Bayes’ Theorem 
Suppose I hold this sheet of paper out under a greying sky, and 
wait until the first spot of rain drops within the area E.  What is 
the probability that this will also lie within the area H? 
 
The answer is “about 0.75”, because this is the chance that the 
rain drop will be in the area marked “E & H”, given that  it is in 
the area E.  The overlap area E & H – where both E and H are 
“true” – constitutes roughly three quarters of E. 
It can be helpful to think of probabilities in terms of these sorts 
of diagrams, where the regions represent “spaces of possible 
situations” whose areas are proportional to their probabilities.  
(You might like to imagine Destiny throwing a dart randomly at the diagram to determine what is going to happen.) E H E & H  4Now suppose that H represents the space of possible situations in 
which some hypothesis  is true, while E represents the space of 
possible situations in which some proposition about evidence  
bearing on the hypothesis is true. 
We can calculate the probability of H given E  as follows: 
    P r ( H  | E) = Pr(E  & H) / Pr(E) 
“Pr(H  | E)” means the probability of H, given that E is true  – that 
is, the probability to be given to H once we know that E is true (so this is called a conditional  probability).  By contrast, “Pr(E)” 
is the initial probability of E  – the probability that E had before  
we found out that it was true – and “Pr(E
 & H)” is the initial 
probability of both E and H  – that is, the probability that E and H 
would turn out to be true, before  we found out that E was true. 
This result, a simple form of Bayes’ Theorem , is essential 
background for understanding Hume’s argument concerning 
miracles in probabilistic terms.  In my talk, I use “M” (instead of “H”) to signify some unlikely event, and “t(M)” (instead of “E”) to signify some testimony for that event.  The symbol “¬” is used 
to mean “not”.  5The Diagnostic Test example 
Suppose that I develop a test to diagnose a debilitating genetic 
condition which suddenly manifests itself in middle age, but 
which fortunately afflicts only one person in a million.  The 
test is fairly reliable, in that no matter who is tested, and 
whether they actually have the disease or not, the chance that 
the test will give a correct diag nosis is 99·9%, an d an incorrect 
diagnosis only 0·1%.  Fred, a hypochondriac, anxious because 
of his approaching fiftieth birthday, comes to my clinic for a 
test, which much to his horror proves positive.  On the basis of this information, is it probable that Fred has the disease? 
To put his mind at ease, Fred might ask himself:  “ Is the test 
of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more surprising, 
than the disease, which it indicates? ” 
In fact the falsehood of the test would be much less surprising 
than it would be for Fred to have the disease.  Hence if we calculate the probabilities of a true-positive and of a false-
positive result, we find that the latter is far greater (by a factor 
of 1001, so Fred’s probability of illness is only 1 in 1002):
1 
 True positive:  000,000,11 ×  000,1999 =  000,000,000,1999 
 False positive:  000,000,1999,999 ×  000,11 =  000,000,000,1999,999 
                              
1 Imagine the test being performed on a billion people, one thousand of whom have the 
disease.  We’d expect 999 true positives, and 999,999 false positives (1001 times as many).  6The Aleph Particle Detector example 
Imagine that I am conducting an experiment on some type of 
sub-atomic particle – let’s call them “aleph” ( א )particles – 
created by nuclear collisions.  Whenever a relevant collision 
takes place, various particles result, and let us suppose that 
1% of these collisions will yield an א particle (event “M”).  
My detector is highly reliable, but not infallible: if an א 
particle is present, it will be registered with 99.9% probability, 
but 0.1% of those collisions  that do not create an א particle 
will also register on the detector (hence both “false negatives” 
and “false positives” have an identical probability of 0.1%).  
Now suppose that on the next collision, my detector gives a positive result (testimony “t(M)”) – should I believe it? 
The initial probabilities of a positive result are: 
 True positive:     Pr(M & t(M))   =  1% × 99.9%   =   0.999% 
 False positive:    Pr(¬M & t(M)) =  99% × 0.1%   =   0.099% 
So the overall probability of a positive result = 0.999% + 0.099% 
= 1.098%, and applying Bayes’ Theorem: 
 Pr(M  | t(M)) = Pr(M  & t(M)) / Pr(t(M)) 
    = 0.999% / 1.098%  = 0.9098… ≈ 91%  ≈ 1110 
This fits, because a True positive is around 10 times as likely as 
a False positive.  The “testimony” of my detector is credible!  7Bibliography

Earman, John (2002), “Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles”, Proceedings of the British 
Academy  113: 91-109 
Earman attacks Hume aggressively, describing the argument concerning miracles as “tame and 
derivative and something of a muddle” (2002, p. 93)),  “a shambles from which little emerges intact, 
save for posturing and pompous solemnity” (2002, p. 108).  However he misinterprets Hume’s 
argument badly, and the account given in my talk is intended to refute his dismissal of it.

A very useful discussion of various issues that  can make Hume’s argument hard to understand.  
Focuses on pure philosophical points rather than discussing probabilistic interpretations. 
 
 
Hume, David (1748/77), Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding , ed. Peter

Gives Hume’s final edition, together with other relevant Hume texts (e.g. the Abstract, “Of the 
Immortality of the Soul”, excerpts from the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, and various 
letters).  Also includes editorial material to se t the work in context and assist with understanding 
(e.g. explanatory notes, a glossary, and a glossari al index of major philosophers and philosophical 
movements).  The Introduction sketches the relevant history of philosophy from Aristotle to the Early 
Modern period, putting Hume’s interests – notably religion – in a wider context.  8 
Hume, David (1779), Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , ed. Norman Kemp 
Smith, Nelson, second edition 1947 
The funniest truly great work of Philosophy ever written!  Hume’s famous demolition of the Design 
Argument for God’s existence.  The Kemp Smith edition is standardly used for references, but there 
are several good modern editions, e.g. edited by John Gaskin in the Oxford University Press 
“World’s Classics” series, or by Martin Bell in the “Penguin Classics” series.  To start with you 
may find the 18th century English a bit hard to get used to, but once you’re over that hurdle, it’s 
entertaining and extremely hard-hitting.
