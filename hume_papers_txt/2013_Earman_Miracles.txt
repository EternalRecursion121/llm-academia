CHAPTER 19
Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles
JOHN EARMAN
My topic is the Bayesian analysis of miracles. To make the discussion concrete, 
I will set it in the context of eighteenth-century debate on miracles, and I will 
focus on the response to David Hume’s celebrated argument against miracles 
that Thomas Bayes would have made and did in part make, albeit from beyond 
the grave, through his colleague Richard Price.
1. My trinity: Bayes, Price, and Hume
It is irresistible to think that Thomas Bayes had read Hume and that Bayes’ 
“Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances” was at least 
in part a reaction to Hume’s skeptical attack on induction.1 But while the 
Appendix of the published paper is surely making reference to Hume, that 
Appendix was penned not by Bayes but by Richard Price. It is also nice to think 
that Hume read Bayes’ essay and then to speculate about what Hume’s reac-
tion would have been. But while there is a reference to Bayes’ essay in Price’s  
Four Dissertations , a copy of which was sent to Hume who duly acknowledged 
receiving and reading it (see below), there is no evidence that Hume followed 
up the reference. And even if he had, it is unlikely that he would have under-
stood Bayes’ essay since he was largely innocent of the technical developments 
that were taking place in the probability calculus.
While there is no evidence of a direct connection between Bayes and Hume, 
the indirect connection that goes through Price is solid. Although we know 
little of the relationship between Bayes and Price, it must have been reasonably 
close since Bayes’ will left £200 to be divided between Price and one John Boyl 
258Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles   259
(see Barnard 1958) and since it was Price who arranged for the posthumous 
publication of Bayes’ essay. In the other direction, Price was a persistent critic 
of Hume—not just on induction but on matters of religion and ethics as well. 
Despite the sharp differences in opinion the two men remained on remarkably 
cordial terms, dining together in London and in Price’s home in Newington 
Green (see Thomas, 1924). In the second edition of Four Dissertations Hume 
is lauded by Price as “a writer whose genius and abilities are so distinguished as 
to be above any of my commendations” (Price 1768, 382). And Hume in turn 
praised Price for the “civility which you have treated me” (Hume 1954, 233–
4). More intriguingly, Hume goes on to say that “I own to you, that the Light 
in which you have put this Controversy [about miracles] is new and plausible 
and ingenious, and perhaps solid”. Unfortunately, Hume left the matter hang-
ing by adding that “I must have some more time to weigh it, before I can pro-
nounce this Judgment with satisfaction to myself” (Ibid.).
I will finish Hume’s unfinished task. I will claim that Price’s criticisms of 
Hume’s argument against miracles were largely solid. More generally, I claim 
that when Hume’s “Of miracles” is examined through the lens of Bayesianism, 
it is seen to be a shambles.2
2. The context
The debate on miracles which took place in eighteenth-century Britain is rich 
and endlessly fascinating. One of the key philosophical problems underly-
ing the debate was posed before the beginning of the century in Locke’s  Essay 
Concerning Human Understanding ; namely, how should one apportion belief 
when the two main sources of credibility, “common observation in like cases” 
and “particular testimonies”, are at odds? The case of eyewitness testimony 
to miraculous events—the central focus of Hume’s “Of miracles”—presents 
the extreme form of this problem. The miraculous event around which the 
eighteenth-century debate swirled was, of course, the Resurrection of Jesus 
of Nazareth, though the more prudent naysayers took care to make oblique 
reference to this matter—Hume, for example, couches his discussion in terms 
of the hypothetical case of the resurrection of Queen Elizabeth.
To convey a bit of the flavor of the debate I will trace one of the many 
threads—the one that starts with Thomas Woolston, one of the incautious 
naysayers. His Six Discourses on the Miracles of Our Saviour (1727–29) was an 
undisguised and broadsided attack on the New Testament miracles. As attested 
by Swift, it created a minor sensation:3
Here is Woolston’s tract, the twelfth edition
’Tis read by every politician:
The country members when in town
To all their boroughs send them down:260  John Earman
You never met a thing so smart;
The courtiers have them all by heart.
What the courtiers learned from reading Woolston was that the New Testa-
ment accounts of miracles were filled with “absurdities, improbabilities, and 
incredibilities”. While Woolston’s charges and his sarcasm and obvious con-
tempt for the Church authorities won him a large readership—reportedly, 
30,000 copies of Six Discourses were printed—they also earned him a fine and 
a stay in prison, where he died.
Six Discourses received a number of replies, the most influential being 
Thomas Sherlock’s Tryal of the Witnesses (1728), which itself went through 
fourteen editions. Sherlock was answered by Peter Annet (I744a, 1744b), and 
Annet in turn was answered by Chandler (1744), Jackson (1744), and West 
(1747). And so it went.
Set in this context, Hume’s essay on miracles seems both tame and deriva-
tive. It is also something of a muddle. What appears on first reading to be a 
powerful and seamless argument turns on closer examination to be a series 
of considerations that don’t comfortably mesh. And worse, Hume’s thesis 
remains obscure—the possibilities range from the banal to the absurd:
(T1) One should be cautious in accepting testimony to marvelous and 
miraculous events, and doubly so when religious themes arise.
(T2)  The testimonies of the Disciples do not establish the credibility of 
the resurrection of Jesus.
(T3) In no recorded case does the testimony of eyewitnesses establish the 
credibility of a miracle deemed to have religious significance.
(T4) Eyewitness testimony is incapable of establishing the credibility of a 
miracle deemed to have religious significance.
(T5) Eyewitness testimony is incapable of establishing the credibility of 
any miraculous event.
Hume deserves no credit—save for pompous solemnity—for uttering various 
forms of the banality (T1), since even the pro-miracle proponents in the eight-
eenth-century debate were at pains to acknowledge the pitfalls of eyewitness 
testimony and the need to carefully sift the evidence, especially in the case of 
religious miracles. Hume believed (T2), but refused to join Annet, Sherlock, 
Woolston, et al. in arguing the specifics. He surely also believed something in 
the neighbourhood of (T3), but his cursory recitation and rejection in Part 
II of his essay of a number of sacred and profane miracles hardly counts as 
much of an argument for this sweeping thesis. What Hume manages beauti-
fully is the creation of an illusion that he was in possession of principles for 
evaluating evidence that allowed him to remain above the nastiness of the fray. 
This would have been the case if he had been in possession of principles that Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles   261
entailed (T4) or (T5). But there are no such principles since (T4) and (T5) are 
absurd. A skilful oscillation among these various theses is what helps to create 
the illusion of a worthy argument against miracles.
Stripped of the theology, the key issue addressed in Hume’s essay is how to 
evaluate the evidential force of fallible witnesses. The obvious tool to apply was 
the probability calculus, and one of the first published applications in English 
was the anonymous (George Hooper?) essay “A Calculation of the Credibility 
of Human Testimony”, which appeared in the 1699  Transactions of the Royal 
Society . Some advances were made in the eighteenth century—for example, by 
Price—but it was not until the work of Laplace (1812, 1814) and Charles Bab-
bage (1838) that definitive results were obtained. Hume’s pronouncements 
on the key issue have that combination of vagueness, obscurity, and aphorism 
that philosophers find irresistible, and, consequently, have led to an endless 
and largely unfruitful debate in the philosophical literature, the contributors 
to which are willing to go to extraordinary lengths in an attempt to show that 
Hume had something interesting to say on the matter.
To state what should be obvious, but still manages to elude some commen-
tators, the core issues in Hume’s essay are independent of the theological sub-
tleties of that vexed term ‘miracle’. For what an eyewitness testifies to in the 
first instance is the occurrence of an event which can be characterized in purely 
naturalistic terms, e.g., the return to life of a dead man. How such an event, 
if its credibility is established by eyewitness testimony, can serve theological 
purposes is a matter I will take up in due course. But first I have to substanti-
ate my negative evaluation of Hume’s treatment of eyewitness testimony. At 
the same time I hope to show how the issues can be advanced with the help of 
Bayes’ apparatus.
3. Hume’s ‘proof’ against miracles
Here is Hume’s ‘proof’, such as it is:
A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable 
experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from 
the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience 
can possibly be imagined.
(E 10.12)
For Hume ‘proofs’ are “such arguments from experience as leave no room for 
doubt or opposition” (E 6, note to title). He thought his proof against miracles 
fitted this bill since it is ‘full and certain when taken alone, because it implies 
no doubt, as in the case of all probabilities’ (Hume 1932, 1.350). In probability 
language, Hume seems to be saying that if L is a lawlike generalization, such as 
‘No dead man returns to life’, and E records uniform past experience in favor 262  John Earman
of L, then P (L | E) = 1; hence, if M asserts a violation of  L, then it follows from 
the rules of probability that P (M | E) = O.
Price opposed Hume’s wildly incautious and inaccurate account of induc-
tive practice: “It must be remembered, that the greatest uniformity and fre-
quency of experience will not offer a proper proof, that an event will happen in 
a future trial” (Price 1768, 393) . . . The relevant thing to note for present pur-
poses is that Hume’s account of inductive practice is descriptively inaccurate: 
scientists don’t think that uniform experience in favor of a lawlike generaliza-
tion leaves no room for doubt—if they did it would be hard to explain their 
continued efforts to search for exceptions.
But the crucial point is that Hume recognized that his ‘proof’ only applies 
when the evidence consists of uniform experience (recall the qualifier ‘when 
taken alone’). The real issue is joined when that proof is opposed by a coun-
terproof from eyewitness testimony. Many commentators from Hume’s 
day to the present have read Hume as saying that this contest has a preor-
dained outcome. The idea is that the probative force of eyewitness testimony 
derives from the observation of the conformity between the testimony and 
reality; but whereas our experience in favor of the relevant lawlike generali-
zation and, thus, against an exception that constitutes a miracle, is uniform, 
our experience as to the trustworthiness of witnesses is anything but uni-
form. Thus, Price took Hume to be arguing that to believe a miracle on the 
basis of testimony is to “prefer a weaker proof to a stronger” (Price 1768, 
385).4 Such a reading makes Hume’s essay into a puzzle: if this was Hume’s 
argument, why did the essay have to be more than one page long? And apart 
from the puzzle, the position being attributed to Hume implies the absurd 
thesis (T5).
The anti-miracle forces in the eighteenth-century debate sometimes asserted 
that uniform experience always trumps testimony. Such assertions were met 
with variations of Locke’s example of the king of Siam who had never seen 
water and refused to believe the Dutch ambassador’s report that, during the 
winter in Holland, water became so hard as to support the weight of an ele-
phant. Thus, in the Tryal of the Witnesses (1728), published almost a decade 
before Hume got the idea for his miracle essay,5 Sherlock puts the rhetorical 
question: “[W]hen the Thing testify’d is contrary to the Order of Nature, and, 
at first sight at least, impossible, what Evidence can be sufficient to overturn 
the constant Evidence of Nature, which she gives us in the constant and regular 
Method of her Operation?” (Sherlock 1728, 58). Sherlock answers his rhetori-
cal question with a version of Locke’s example: what do the naysayers against 
the Resurrection have to say “more than any man who never saw Ice might say 
against an hundred honest witnesses, who assert that Water turns into Ice in 
cold Climates?” (Sherlock 1728, 60). That Hume’s contemporaries were not 
impressed by his miracles essay is partly explained by the fact that he seemed 
to be offering a warmed-up version of the past debate, and a defective version Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles   263
at that, since the 1748 edition of the Enquiry is silent on the issues raised by 
Locke’s example.6
Let’s be charitable to Hume by not subscribing to the reading that takes 
him to be saying that uniform experience always trumps eyewitness testimony. 
The issue then becomes how to tell when the balance tips in favor of one or 
the other. Hume’s famous ‘maxim’ might be thought to provide just such a 
prescription.
4. Hume’s maxim
Hume announces the ‘general maxim’
That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony 
be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the 
fact, which it endeavours to establish. 
(E 10.13)
Most commentators have seen profound wisdom here. I see only triviality. 
Suppose that we are in a situation where witnesses have offered testimony t 
(M) to the occurrence of the miraculous event  M. Let E be the record of our 
past experience in favour of the lawlike generalization to which M is an excep-
tion. Then, as good Bayesians, our current degree of belief function should 
be the conditionalization on t (M)& E of the function P (·) we had before 
obtaining this evidence. Thus, the relevant probability of the event which the 
testimony endeavors to establish is P (M | t (M)& E), while the relevant prob-
ability of the falsehood of the testimony is P (¬ M | t (M)& E). To say that 
the falsehood of the testimony is more miraculous than the event which it 
endeavors to establish is just to say that the latter probability is smaller than 
the former, i.e.
P(M|t (M)&E) > P (¬M|t (M)&E) (1)
which is equivalent to
P(M|t (M)&E) > 0.5. (2)
On this reading, Hume’s maxim is the correct but unhelpful principle that no 
testimony is sufficient to establish the credibility of a miracle unless the testi-
mony makes the miracle more likely than not.
A number of other renderings of Hume’s maxim have been offered, but 
either they fail to do justice to the text of Hume’s essay or else they turn Hume’s 
maxim into a false principle (see Earman 2000 for details) . . .264  John Earman
5. Hume’s diminution principle
This principle is enunciated by Hume in the following passage:
[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, 
greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual.
(E 10.8)
In citing the proverbial Roman saying, “I should not believe such a story were 
it told me by Cato”, Hume intimates that in the case of a miracle the diminu-
tion of the evidential force of testimony is total.
Price responded that “improbabilities as such do not lessen the capacity of 
testimony to report the truth” (Price 1768, 413). This is surely right, as was 
Price’s further claim that the diminution effect operates through the factors 
of the intent to deceive and the danger of being deceived, either by others 
or by oneself. Unfortunately Price overstepped himself in claiming that when 
the first factor is absent, testimony “communicates its own probability” to the 
event (Price 1768, 414). It was left to Laplace (1814) to give a correct and thor-
ough Bayesian analysis of when and how the intent to deceive and the danger 
of being deceived give rise to a diminution effect. Two cases suffice to illustrate 
the results that can emerge from the analysis.
The first case—one considered by Price—concerns a witness who testifies t 
(W79) that the winning ticket in a fair lottery with N tickets is #79. Assuming 
that when the witness misreports, she has no tendency to report one wrong 
number over another, then
P(W79|t (W79) & E) = P (t (W79)|(W79) & E) (3)
where E records the background knowledge of the lottery. And this is so 
regardless of how large N is and, thus, regardless of how small the prior 
probability P (W79 | E) = 1/  N. In such a case the testimony does, in Price’s 
words, communicate its own probability to the event. But, as Price was well 
aware, (3) does not hold if the witness has some ulterior interest in reporting 
#79 as the winner.
The second case concerns the testimony t (W) that a ball drawn at random 
from an urn containing one white ball and  N–1 black balls is white. As long as 
there is a non-zero probability that the witness misperceives the color of the 
ball drawn, or else there is a non-zero probability that the witness misreports 
the correctly perceived color, the posterior probability P (W | t (W) & E) does 
diminish as N is increased and, thus, as the prior probability P (W | E) = 1/  N 
is reduced.7
The difference between the two cases lies in the fact that in the urn case, 
as the prior probability is reduced the likelihood factor P (t (W)|¬ W & E)/ Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles   265
P (t (W)| W & E) remains the same because the visual stimulus presented to 
the witness when either a black or a white ball is drawn is independent of the 
numbers of black and white balls in the urn. By contrast, in the lottery case the 
corresponding likelihood factor changes in such a way as to cancel the change 
in the prior factor, quenching the diminution effect.
Two comments are in order. First, I see no a priori reason to think that 
cases of reported miracles are always or even mostly like the urn case in that 
they are subject to the diminution effect. Even when the reported miracle 
is subject to the diminution effect, Hume gets his intended moral only for 
one order of quantifiers; namely, for any given fallible witness (who may 
practise deceit or who is subject to misperception, deceit, or self-deception), 
there is a story so a priori implausible that we should not believe the story 
if told by that witness. It does not follow that there is a story so a priori 
implausible (unless, of course, the prior probability is flatly zero) that for 
any fallible witness, we should not believe the story if told by that witness. 
To get this latter implication one needs the extra postulate that there are in-
principle bounds below which the probability of errors of reporting cannot 
be reduced. Hume’s cynicism suggests such a postulate, but cynicism is not 
an argument.
6. Multiple witnesses
Hume makes some nods to the importance of multiple witnessing, but he 
seems not to have been aware of how powerful a consideration it can be. In 
fairness, the power was clearly and fully revealed only in the work of Laplace 
(1812, 1814) and more especially the work of Babbage (1838), whose Ninth 
Bridgewater Treatise devotes a chapter to a refutation of Hume’s argument 
against miracles.
Suppose that there are N fallible witnesses, all of whom testify to the occur-
rence of an event  M. For simplicity suppose that the witnesses are all equally 
fallible in that for all  i = 1, 2, . . ., N
P(ti (M)| M & E) = p, P(ti (M)|¬M & E) = q  (4)
And suppose that conditional on the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of  M, 
the testimonies of the witnesses are independent in the sense that
P(t1(M) &t2(M) & . . . & t N(M) | ± M & E)
= P(t1(M)|±M &E) × P(t2(M)| ± M & E) × . . . × P(tN(M)| ± M & E) (5)
where ±  M stands for M or ¬  M, and where the choice is made uniformly on 
both sides of the equality. Then the concurrent testimony of all N witnesses 
gives a posterior probability266  John Earman
P(M | t1(M) &t2(M) & . . . & tN(M) & E) = 1

(| ) (6)
The witnesses may be very fallible in the sense that q can be as close to 1 as you 
like. But as long as they are minimally reliable in the sense that  p > q, it follows 
from (6) that the posterior probability of M can be pushed as close to 1 as you 
like by a sufficiently large cloud of such fallible but minimally reliable wit-
nesses—provided, of course, that P (M|E) > 0. Using this result Babbage was 
able to give some nice examples where just twelve minimally reliable witnesses 
can push the posterior probability of an initially very improbable event to a 
respectably high level.
In sum, if we set aside Hume’s wildly optimistic account of induction on 
which P (M|E) = 0, then he must agree that fallible multiple witnesses can 
establish the credibility of a miracle, provided that their testimonies are inde-
pendent in the sense of (5) and that they are minimally reliable in the sense 
that p > q. Which of these provisos would Hume have rejected? The answer is 
‘Neither’, at least in some cases of secular miracles, such as in his hypothetical 
example of eight days of total darkness around the world.
[S]uppose, all authors, in all languages, agree, that, from the first of Janu-
ary 1600, there was total darkness over the whole earth for eight days: 
Suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event is still strong and 
lively among the people: that all travellers, who return from foreign coun-
tries, bring us accounts of the same tradition without the least variation 
or contradiction: It is evident, that our present philosophers, instead of 
doubting the fact, ought to receive it as certain. . . . 
(E 10.36)
But in cases to which religious significance is attached, Hume professed to 
be unswayed by even the largest cloud of witnesses. In the hypothetical case 
of the resurrection of Queen Elizabeth, Hume declared that he would ‘not 
have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event’ (E 10.37), even 
if all the members of the court and Parliament proclaimed it. Here it is less 
plausible than in the previous case that the independence assumption is satis-
fied since the witnesses can be influenced by each other and the general hub-
bub surrounding the events. But there seems to be no in-principle difficulty 
in arranging the circumstances so as to secure the independence condition. 
The minimal reliability condition becomes suspect if the alleged resurrection 
is invested with religious significance because witnesses in the grip of religious 
fervor tend to be more credulous and because they may give in to the tempta-
tion to practise deceit in order to win over the unconverted. But it is an insult Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles   267
to the quality of the eighteenth-century debate to think that the participants 
needed a sermonette on this topic from Hume. The pro-miracle proponents 
were acutely aware of the need to scrutinize the contextual factors that might 
give clues as to the reliability of the witnesses. The conclusions they drew from 
their scrutiny may have been mistaken, but if so, the mistakes did not flow 
from a failure to heed the empty solemnities of Hume’s essay. Hume’s treat-
ment of the hypothetical Queen Elizabeth case drips with cynicism:
[S]hould this miracle be ascribed to any new system of religion; men, in 
all ages, have been so much imposed on by ridiculous stories of that kind, 
that this very circumstance would be a full proof of cheat, and sufficient, 
with all men of sense, not only to make them reject the fact, but even 
reject it without farther examination.
(E 10.38)
The cynicism remains just cynicism unless it is backed by an argument show-
ing that, in principle, the witnesses cannot be minimally reliable and inde-
pendent when the alleged miracle is ascribed to a system of religion. Such an 
argument is not to be found in Hume’s “Of miracles”.
7. Miracles as a just foundation for religion
Grant that nothing in principle blocks the use of eyewitness testimony to 
establish the credibility of a miracle—say, a resurrection—of supposed reli-
gious significance. It might still seem that Hume has safe ground to which 
to retreat. On his behalf one can argue that to serve as a ‘just foundation for 
religion’, the miracle must not only satisfy Hume’s first definition of ‘miracle’ 
as a violation of a (putative) law of nature but must also satisfy the second 
definition, according to which a miracle is “a transgression of a law of nature 
by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible 
agent” (E 10.12n). But (still continuing on Hume’s behalf, now in the voice of 
John Stuart Mill), nothing can ever prove that the resurrection is miraculous 
in the sense of Hume’s second definition because “there is still another possi-
ble hypothesis, that of its being the result of some unknown natural cause; and 
this possibility cannot be so completely shut out as to leave no alternative but 
that of admitting the existence and intervention of a being superior to nature” 
(Mill 1843, 440).
This line is used over and again across the decades by commentators sympa-
thetic to Hume. It is apt to strike the innocent reader as a powerful considera-
tion, but when the context is filled in it is seen as unavailing against the more 
sophisticated eighteenth-century pro-miracles proponents. For . . . the role 
these proponents saw for miracles was not that of a direct and full proof of 
the presence of God by marks of a supernatural intervention in human affairs. 268  John Earman
Rather, the miraculous figured in an argument whose goal was to render reli-
gious doctrines highly credible and, ideally, to give them the kind of moral 
assurance needed to render a jury verdict of beyond reasonable doubt. And to 
fulfill this role, miracles need not be conceived as supernatural interventions; 
they need only serve as probabilistic indicators of the truth of the religious 
doctrines.
To illustrate how miracles can serve to confirm religious doctrines, suppose 
that testimonial evidence t (M) has incrementally confirmed M:
P(M | t(M) & E) > P (M | E) (7)
Suppose also that the testimony bears on the religious doctrine D only through 
M in that
P(D | ± M& ± t(M) & E) = P (D | ± M & E) (8)
And suppose finally that
P(M | D & E) > P(M |¬D & E) (9)
Then it follows that
P(D | t(M) & E) > P(D | E) (10)
that is, t (M) incrementally confirms  D.
Condition (8) is surely unobjectionable. Condition (9) is the sense in which 
M serves as a probabilistic indicator of the truth of  D, and to fulfill this role M 
need not be the result of a supernatural intervention that disrupts the order 
of nature. And condition (9) is seemingly easy to satisfy. For example, isn’t it 
obvious that the miracle of the loaves is more likely on the assumption that 
Christian doctrine is true than on the assumption that it is false? In fact, it is 
not obvious. In general, whether or not (9) is satisfied depends on what alter-
natives are included in ¬D and what their prior probabilities are.8 Consider, 
for example, the case where a high prior is given to the possibility that there is a 
non-Christian deceiver God who actualizes a world containing events designed 
to mislead people into falsely believing Christian doctrine. And even when D 
is incrementally confirmed by t (M), there is no assurance that evidence of 
other miracles will push the probability of D anywhere near that required for 
moral certainty—again, it depends on the available alternatives and their prior 
probabilities.
So the discouraging word is that Bayesianism does not pave an easy road 
for religion. But by the same token there is no obvious difference here with 
theoretical physics: whether and how much a physical theory T that postulates Bayes, Hume, Price, and Miracles   269
unobservable properties of unobservable elementary particles is confirmed by 
direct or testimonial evidence about streaks in cloud chambers depends on 
what alternatives to T are entertained and what priors these alternatives are 
assigned.
8. Parting company
Let us agree for present purposes . . . that the subjectivist form of Bayesianism 
captures the logic of inductive reasoning. . . . By these lights it is rational to give 
high degrees of belief to miracles; indeed . . . given various kinds of eyewitness 
testimony that it is in principle possible to obtain, it would be irrational not 
to give a high credibility to miracles. Further, miracles can be used to support 
rational credence in theological doctrines.
Thus far I have marched shoulder to shoulder with the pro-miracle forces. 
But now I drop out of the parade, and this for two reasons. First, my degree 
of belief function—which I immodestly assume to satisfy the Bayesian stric-
tures—disagrees with, for example, Professor Swinburne’s (1970, 1979) 
function—which I have no doubt satisfies the strictures.9 Second, and more 
important, I think that these differences are matters of taste in that there is no 
objective basis to prefer one over the other. One way to find objectivity in the 
framework of subjective Bayesianism is through an evidence-driven merger of 
opinion (aka ‘washing out of priors’10). Such a consensus, however, is hollow 
unless it is in principle possible that the accumulating evidence produces the 
merger of opinion by driving the posterior probability to 1 on the true hypoth-
eses and 0 on the false hypotheses. But for theological hypotheses, whose truth 
values do not supervene on the totality of empirical evidence—no matter how 
liberally that evidence is construed—the desired convergence to certainty is 
impossible . . .11
9. Conclusion
I trust that I have displeased all parties. I hope to have upset the devotees of 
Hume’s miracles essay by showing that a Bayesian examination reveals Hume’s 
seemingly powerful argument to be a shambles from which little emerges 
intact, save for posturing and pompous solemnities. At the same time I hope I 
have given no comfort to the pro-miracle forces. I personally do not give much 
credibility to religious miracles and religious doctrines. And while I acknowl-
edge that those who do can be just as rational as I am, I suspect that degrees 
of belief in religious doctrines cannot have an objective status if a necessary 
condition for such a status is the existence of a reliable procedure for learning, 
from all possible empirical evidence, the truth values of these doctrines. The 
proof, or disproof, of this suspicion would, I think, constitute an important 
contribution to the philosophy of religion.270  John Earman

 1. Bayes’ essay was published posthumously in 1763. It was probably written in the 1740s.
 2. A first draft of Hume’s essay on miracles was written (probably) in 1737. But the essay did 
not appear in print until 1748 when it was published as Chapter 10 (‘Of miracles’) of Hume’s 
Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding, later called Enquiry Concern-
ing Human Understanding. The internal evidence indicates that the published version of 
Hume’s miracles essay was written in the 1740s.
 3. Quoted in Burns (1981). Burns’s book provides a good overview of the eighteenth-century 
miracles debate.
 4. And C. D. Broad took Hume to be saying that “we have never the right to believe any alleged 
miracle however strong the testimony for it may be” (Broad 1916–17, 80).
 5. Hume tells us that he got the idea during his stay in La Flèche (1736–37); see Hume (1932, 
1.361).
 6. Hume’s ‘Indian prince’ example makes its appearance in a hastily added endnote to the 1750 
edition. In later editions a paragraph and a long footnote on the Indian prince were added to 
the text.
 7. Editors’ note: the original printing of this paper stated the second formula as ‘P(W|E) = 
1/(N–1)’, which appears to be a misprint
 8. An exception is the hypothetico-deductive case where D entails M.
 9. It is only here that I part company with Professor Swinburne, from whom I learned to apply 
Bayesianism to religious matters.
 10. This phrase is misleading since the likelihoods, which in many cases are just as subjective as 
the priors, have to wash out too.
 11. Editors’ note: The remainder of §8 gives technical support to this claim.
